"Klipper uses an [iterative "

"System time. The system time uses the system's monotonic clock - it "
"is a floating point number stored as seconds and it is (generally) "
"relative to when the host computer was last started. System times "
"have limited use in the software - they are primarily used when "
"interacting with the operating system. Within the host code, system "
"times are frequently stored in variables named *eventtime* or "
"*curtime*."

"Print time. The print time is synchronized to the main micro-"
"controller clock (the micro-controller defined in the \"[mcu]\" "
"config section). It is a floating point number stored as seconds and "
"is relative to when the main mcu was last restarted. It is possible "
"to convert from a \"print time\" to the main micro-controller's "
"hardware clock by multiplying the print time by the mcu's statically "
"configured frequency rate. The high-level host code uses print times "
"to calculate almost all physical actions (eg, head movement, heater "
"changes, etc.). Within the host code, print times are generally "
"stored in variables named *print_time* or *move_time*."

"MCU clock. This is the hardware clock counter on each micro-"
"controller. It is stored as an integer and its update rate is "
"relative to the frequency of the given micro-controller. The host "
"software translates its internal times to clocks before transmission "
"to the mcu. The mcu code only ever tracks time in clock ticks. Within"
" the host code, clock values are tracked as 64bit integers, while the"
" mcu code uses 32bit integers. Within the host code, clocks are "
"generally stored in variables with names containing *clock* or "
"*ticks*."

msgid ""
"32bit and 64bit clocks: To reduce bandwidth and to improve micro-"
"controller efficiency, clocks on the micro-controller are tracked as "
"32bit integers. When comparing two clocks in the mcu code, the "
"`timer_is_before()` function must always be used to ensure integer "
"rollovers are handled properly. The host software converts 32bit "
"clocks to 64bit clocks by appending the high-order bits from the last"
" mcu timestamp it has received - no message from the mcu is ever more"
" than 2^31 clock ticks in the future or past so this conversion is "
"never ambiguous. The host converts from 64bit clocks to 32bit clocks "
"by simply truncating the high-order bits. To ensure there is no "
"ambiguity in this conversion, the **klippy/chelper/serialqueue.c** "
"code will buffer messages until they are within 2^31 clock ticks of "
"their target time."

"Multiple micro-controllers: The host software supports using multiple"
" micro-controllers on a single printer. In this case, the \"MCU "
"clock\" of each micro-controller is tracked separately. The "
"clocksync.py code handles clock drift between micro-controllers by "
"modifying the way it converts from \"print time\" to \"MCU clock\". "
"On secondary mcus, the mcu frequency that is used in this conversion "
"is regularly updated to account for measured drift."
