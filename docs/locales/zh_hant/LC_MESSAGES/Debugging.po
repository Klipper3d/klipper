msgid "Translating gcode files to micro-controller commands"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Klippy host code can run in a batch mode to produce the low-level"
" micro-controller commands associated with a gcode file. Inspecting "
"these low-level commands is useful when trying to understand the "
"actions of the low-level hardware. It can also be useful to compare "
"the difference in micro-controller commands after a code change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To run Klippy in this batch mode, there is a one time step necessary "
"to generate the micro-controller \"data dictionary\". This is done by"
" compiling the micro-controller code to obtain the "
"**out/klipper.dict** file:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the above is done it is possible to run Klipper in batch mode "
"(see [installation](Installation.md) for the steps necessary to build"
" the python virtual environment and a printer.cfg file):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above will produce a file **test.serial** with the binary serial "
"output. This output can be translated to readable text with:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resulting file **test.txt** contains a human readable list of "
"micro-controller commands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The batch mode disables certain response / request commands in order "
"to function. As a result, there will be some differences between "
"actual commands and the above output. The generated data is useful "
"for testing and inspection; it is not useful for sending to a real "
"micro-controller."

msgid "Testing with simulavr"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The [simulavr](http://www.nongnu.org/simulavr/) tool enables one to "
"simulate an Atmel ATmega micro-controller. This section describes how"
" one can run test gcode files through simulavr. It is recommended to "
"run this on a desktop class machine (not a Raspberry Pi) as it does "
"require significant cpu to run efficiently."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use simulavr, download the simulavr package and compile with "
"python support:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the build system may need to have some packages (such as "
"swig) installed in order to build the python module. Make sure the "
"file **src/python/_pysimulavr.so** is present after the above "

msgid "To compile Klipper for use in simulavr, run:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"and compile the micro-controller software for an AVR atmega644p, set "
"the MCU frequency to 20Mhz, and select SIMULAVR software emulation "
"support. Then one can compile Klipper (run `make`) and then start the"
" simulation with:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, with simulavr running in another window, one can run the "
"following to read gcode from a file (eg, \"test.gcode\"), process it "

"[installation](Installation.md) for the steps necessary to build the "
"python virtual environment):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using simulavr with gtkwave"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One useful feature of simulavr is its ability to create signal wave "
"generation files with the exact timing of events. To do this, follow "
"the directions above, but run avrsim.py with a command-line like the "
"following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above would create a file **avrsim.vcd** with information on each"
" change to the GPIOs on PORTA and PORTB. This could then be viewed "
"using gtkwave with:"

msgid "Manually sending commands to the micro-controller"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, the host klippy.py process would be used to translate gcode"
" commands to Klipper micro-controller commands. However, it's also "
"possible to manually send these MCU commands (functions marked with "
"the DECL_COMMAND() macro in the Klipper source code). To do so, run:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the \"HELP\" command within the tool for more information on its "

msgid ""
"The Klippy log file (/tmp/klippy.log) stores statistics on bandwidth,"
" micro-controller load, and host buffer load. It can be useful to "

"To generate a graph, a one time step is necessary to install the "
"\"matplotlib\" package:"

msgid "Extracting information from the klippy.log file"

"The Klippy log file (/tmp/klippy.log) also contains debugging "
"information. There is a logextract.py script that may be useful when "
"analyzing a micro-controller shutdown or similar problem. It is "
"typically run with something like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The script will extract the printer config file and will extract MCU "
"shutdown information. The information dumps from an MCU shutdown (if "

msgid "Running the regression tests"

msgid ""
"The main Klipper GitHub repository uses \"github actions\" to run a "
