"Note that sometimes a gearbox will have a slightly different gear "

"57:11`."

"If several gears are used on an axis then it is possible to provide a"

"driving a 16 toothed to 80 toothed pulley could use `gear_ratio: 5:1,"
" 80:16`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, gear_ratio should be defined with whole numbers as "
"common gears and pulleys have a whole number of teeth on them. "
