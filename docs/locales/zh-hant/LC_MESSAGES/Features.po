msgid "Klipper has several compelling features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"High precision stepper movement. Klipper utilizes an application "
"processor (such as a low-cost Raspberry Pi) when calculating printer "
"movements. The application processor determines when to step each "
"stepper motor, it compresses those events, transmits them to the "
"micro-controller, and then the micro-controller executes each event "
"at the requested time. Each stepper event is scheduled with a "
"precision of 25 micro-seconds or better. The software does not use "
"kinematic estimations (such as the Bresenham algorithm) - instead it "
"calculates precise step times based on the physics of acceleration "
"and the physics of the machine kinematics. More precise stepper "
"movement translates to quieter and more stable printer operation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Best in class performance. Klipper is able to achieve high stepping "
"rates on both new and old micro-controllers. Even old 8bit micro-"
"controllers can obtain rates over 175K steps per second. On more "
"recent micro-controllers, rates over 500K steps per second are "
"possible. Higher stepper rates enable higher print velocities. The "
"stepper event timing remains precise even at high speeds which "
"improves overall stability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper supports printers with multiple micro-controllers. For "
"example, one micro-controller could be used to control an extruder, "
"while another controls the printer's heaters, while a third controls "
"the rest of the printer. The Klipper host software implements clock "
"synchronization to account for clock drift between micro-controllers."
" No special code is needed to enable multiple micro-controllers - it "
"just requires a few extra lines in the config file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Configuration via simple config file. There's no need to reflash the "
"micro-controller to change a setting. All of Klipper's configuration "
"is stored in a standard config file which can be easily edited. This "
"makes it easier to setup and maintain the hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper supports \"Smooth Pressure Advance\" - a mechanism to account"
" for the effects of pressure within an extruder. This reduces "
"extruder \"ooze\" and improves the quality of print corners. "
"Klipper's implementation does not introduce instantaneous extruder "
"speed changes, which improves overall stability and robustness."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper supports \"Input Shaping\" to reduce the impact of vibrations"
" on print quality. This can reduce or eliminate \"ringing\" (also "
"known as \"ghosting\", \"echoing\", or \"rippling\") in prints. It "
"may also allow one to obtain faster printing speeds while still "
"maintaining high print quality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper uses an \"iterative solver\" to calculate precise step times "
"from simple kinematic equations. This makes porting Klipper to new "
"types of robots easier and it keeps timing precise even with complex "
"kinematics (no \"line segmentation\" is needed)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Portable code. Klipper works on ARM, AVR, and PRU based micro-"
"controllers. Existing \"reprap\" style printers can run Klipper "
"without hardware modification - just add a Raspberry Pi. Klipper's "
"internal code layout makes it easier to support other micro-"
"controller architectures as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Simpler code. Klipper uses a very high level language (Python) for "
"most code. The kinematics algorithms, the G-code parsing, the heating"
" and thermistor algorithms, etc. are all written in Python. This "
"makes it easier to develop new functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Custom programmable macros. New G-Code commands can be defined in the"
" printer config file (no code changes are necessary). Those commands "
"are programmable - allowing them to produce different actions "
"depending on the state of the printer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Builtin API server. In addition to the standard G-Code interface, "
"Klipper supports a rich JSON based application interface. This "
"enables programmers to build external applications with detailed "
"control of the printer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Additional features"
msgstr ""

msgid "Klipper supports many standard 3d printer features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Works with Octoprint. This allows the printer to be controlled using "
"a regular web-browser. The same Raspberry Pi that runs Klipper can "
"also run Octoprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Standard G-Code support. Common g-code commands that are produced by "
"typical \"slicers\" are supported. One may continue to use Slic3r, "
"Cura, etc. with Klipper."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for multiple extruders. Extruders with shared heaters and "
"extruders on independent carriages (IDEX) are also supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for cartesian, delta, corexy, corexz, rotary delta, polar, "
"and cable winch style printers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Automatic bed leveling support. Klipper can be configured for basic "
"bed tilt detection or full mesh bed leveling. If the bed uses "
"multiple Z steppers then Klipper can also level by independently "
"manipulating the Z steppers. Most Z height probes are supported, "
"including BL-Touch probes and servo activated probes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Automatic delta calibration support. The calibration tool can perform"
" basic height calibration as well as an enhanced X and Y dimension "
"calibration. The calibration can be done with a Z height probe or via"
" manual probing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for common temperature sensors (eg, common thermistors, "
"AD595, AD597, AD849x, PT100, PT1000, MAX6675, MAX31855, MAX31856, "
"MAX31865, BME280, HTU21D, and LM75). Custom thermistors and custom "
"analog temperature sensors can also be configured."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic thermal heater protection enabled by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for standard fans, nozzle fans, and temperature controlled "
"fans. No need to keep fans running when the printer is idle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for run-time configuration of TMC2130, TMC2208/TMC2224, "
"TMC2209, TMC2660, and TMC5160 stepper motor drivers. There is also "
"support for current control of traditional stepper drivers via "
"AD5206, MCP4451, MCP4728, MCP4018, and PWM pins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for common LCD displays attached directly to the printer. A "
"default menu is also available. The contents of the display and menu "
"can be fully customized via the config file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Constant acceleration and \"look-ahead\" support. All printer moves "
"will gradually accelerate from standstill to cruising speed and then "
"decelerate back to a standstill. The incoming stream of G-Code "
"movement commands are queued and analyzed - the acceleration between "
"movements in a similar direction will be optimized to reduce print "
"stalls and improve overall print time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper implements a \"stepper phase endstop\" algorithm that can "
"improve the accuracy of typical endstop switches. When properly tuned"
" it can improve a print's first layer bed adhesion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for measuring and recording acceleration using an adxl345 "
"accelerometer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for limiting the top speed of short \"zigzag\" moves to "
"reduce printer vibration and noise. See the "
"[kinematics](Kinematics.md) document for more information."
