msgid ""
"Klipper uses only CAN 2.0A standard size CAN bus packets, which are "
"limited to 8 data bytes and an 11-bit CAN bus identifier. In order to"
" support efficient communication, each micro-controller is assigned "
"at run-time a unique 1-byte CAN bus nodeid (`canbus_nodeid`) for "
"general Klipper command and response traffic. Klipper command "
"messages going from host to micro-controller use the CAN bus id of "
"`canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256`, while Klipper response messages from "
"micro-controller to host use `canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256 + 1`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each micro-controller has a factory assigned unique chip identifier "
"that is used during id assignment. This identifier can exceed the "
"length of one CAN packet, so a hash function is used to generate a "
"unique 6-byte id (`canbus_uuid`) from the factory id."

msgid "Admin messages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Admin messages are used for id assignment. Admin messages sent from "
"host to micro-controller use the CAN bus id `0x3f0` and messages sent"
" from micro-controller to host use the CAN bus id `0x3f1`. All micro-"
"controllers listen to messages on id `0x3f0`; that id can be thought "
"of as a \"broadcast address\"."

msgid ""
"This command queries all micro-controllers that have not yet been "
"assigned a `canbus_nodeid`. Unassigned micro-controllers will respond"

msgid ""

msgid ""
"The packet data in messages using the node's receive CAN bus id "
"(`canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256`) are simply appended to a buffer, and when"
" a complete [mcu protocol message](Protocol.md) is found its contents"

"there is no requirement for the start of a Klipper message block to "
"align with the start of a CAN bus packet."

"controller to host by copying the message data into one or more "
