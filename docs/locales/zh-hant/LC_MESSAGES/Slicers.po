"This document provides some tips for configuring a \"slicer\" "
"application for use with Klipper. Common slicers used with Klipper "
"are Slic3r, Cura, Simplify3D, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the G-Code flavor to Marlin"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many slicers have an option to configure the \"G-Code flavor\". The "
"default is frequently \"Marlin\" and that works well with Klipper. "
"The \"Smoothieware\" setting also works well with Klipper."
msgstr ""

msgid "Klipper gcode_macro"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Slicers will often allow one to configure \"Start G-Code\" and \"End "
"G-Code\" sequences. It is often convenient to define custom macros in"
" the Klipper config file instead - such as: `[gcode_macro "
"START_PRINT]` and `[gcode_macro END_PRINT]`. Then one can just run "
"START_PRINT and END_PRINT in the slicer's configuration. Defining "
"these actions in the Klipper configuration may make it easier to "
"tweak the printer's start and end steps as changes do not require re-"
"slicing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See [sample-macros.cfg](../config/sample-macros.cfg) for example "
"START_PRINT and END_PRINT macros."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the [config reference](Config_Reference.md#gcode_macro) for "
"details on defining a gcode_macro."
msgstr ""

msgid "Large retraction settings may require tuning Klipper"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The maximum speed and acceleration of retraction moves are controlled"
" in Klipper by the `max_extrude_only_velocity` and "
"`max_extrude_only_accel` config settings. These settings have a "
"default value that should work well on many printers. However, if one"
" has configured a large retraction in the slicer (eg, 5mm or greater)"
" then one may find they limit the desired speed of retractions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If using a large retraction, consider tuning Klipper's [pressure "
"advance](Pressure_Advance.md) instead. Otherwise, if one finds the "
"toolhead seems to \"pause\" during retraction and priming, then "
"consider explicitly defining `max_extrude_only_velocity` and "
"`max_extrude_only_accel` in the Klipper config file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not enable \"coasting\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"coasting\" feature is likely to result in poor quality prints "
"with Klipper. Consider using Klipper's [pressure "
"advance](Pressure_Advance.md) instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifically, if the slicer dramatically changes the extrusion rate "
"between moves then Klipper will perform deceleration and acceleration"
" between moves. This is likely to make blobbing worse, not better."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In contrast, it is okay (and often helpful) to use a slicer's "
"\"retract\" setting, \"wipe\" setting, and/or \"wipe on retract\" "
"setting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not use \"extra restart distance\" on Simplify3d"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This setting can cause dramatic changes to extrusion rates which can "
"trigger Klipper's maximum extrusion cross-section check. Consider "
"using Klipper's [pressure advance](Pressure_Advance.md) or the "
"regular Simplify3d retract setting instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disable \"PreloadVE\" on KISSlicer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If using KISSlicer slicing software then set \"PreloadVE\" to zero. "
"Consider using Klipper's [pressure advance](Pressure_Advance.md) "
"instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disable any \"advanced extruder pressure\" settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some slicers advertise an \"advanced extruder pressure\" capability. "
"It is recommended to keep these options disabled when using Klipper "
"as they are likely to result in poor quality prints. Consider using "
"Klipper's [pressure advance](Pressure_Advance.md) instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifically, these slicer settings can instruct the firmware to make"
" wild changes to the extrusion rate in the hope that the firmware "
"will approximate those requests and the printer will roughly obtain a"
" desirable extruder pressure. Klipper, however, utilizes precise "
"kinematic calculations and timing. When Klipper is commanded to make "
"significant changes to the extrusion rate it will plan out the "
"corresponding changes to velocity, acceleration, and extruder "
"movement - which is not the slicer's intent. The slicer may even "
"command excessive extrusion rates to the point that it triggers "
"Klipper's maximum extrusion cross-section check."
