msgid "Guidelines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the appropriate config filename prefix.The `printer` prefix is"
" used for stock printers sold by a mainstream manufacturer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `generic` prefix is used for a 3d printer board that may be used "
"in many different types of printers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `kit` prefix is for 3d printers that are assembled according to a"
" widely used specification. These \"kit\" printers are generally "
"distinct from normal \"printers\" in that they are not sold by a "
"manufacturer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `sample` prefix is used for config \"snippets\" that one may "
"copy-and-paste into the main config file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `example` prefix is used to describe printer kinematics. This "
"type of config is typically only added along with code for a new type"
" of printer kinematics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the appropriate filename suffix. The `printer` config files must "
"end in a year followed by `.cfg` (eg, `-2019.cfg`). In this case, the"
" year is an approximate year the given printer was sold. All example "
"configuration files must end in `.cfg`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper must be able to start `printer`, `generic`, and `kit` example"
" config file without error. These config files should be added to the"
" [test/klippy/printers.test](../test/klippy/printers.test) regression"
" test case. Add new config files to that test case in the appropriate"
" section and in alphabetical order within that section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The example configuration should be for the \"stock\" configuration "
"of the printer. (There are too many \"customized\" configurations to "
"track in the main Klipper repository.) Similarly, we only add example"
" config files for printers, kits, and boards that have mainstream "
"popularity (eg, there should be at least a 100 of them in active "
"use). Consider using the [Klipper Community Discourse "
"server](https://community.klipper3d.org) for other configs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only specify those devices present on the given printer or board. Do "
"not specify settings specific to your particular setup.For `generic` "
"config files, only those devices on the mainboard should be "
"described. For example, it would not make sense to add a display "
"config section to a \"generic\" config as there is no way to know if "
"the board will be attached to that type of display. If the board has "
"a specific hardware port to facilitate an optional peripheral (eg, a "
"bltouch port) then one can add a \"commented out\" config section for"
" the given device."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not specify `pressure_advance` in an example config, as that value"
" is specific to the filament, not the printer hardware. Similarly, do"
" not specify `max_extrude_only_velocity` nor `max_extrude_only_accel`"
" settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not specify a config section containing a host path or host "
"hardware. For example, do not specify `[virtual_sdcard]` nor "
"`[temperature_host]` config sections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only define macros that utilize functionality specific to the given "
"printer or to define g-codes that are commonly emitted by slicers "
"configured for the given printer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Where possible, it is best to use the same wording, phrasing, "
"indentation, and section ordering as the existing config files.The "
"top of each config file should list the type of micro-controller the "
"user should select during \"make menuconfig\". It should also have a "
"reference to \"docs/Config_Reference.md\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not copy the field documentation into the example config files. "
"(Doing so creates a maintenance burden as an update to the "
"documentation would then require changing it in many places.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Example config files should not contain a \"SAVE_CONFIG\" section. If"
" necessary, copy the relevant fields from the SAVE_CONFIG section to "
"the appropriate section in the main config area."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use `field: value` syntax instead of `field=value`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When adding an extruder `rotation_distance` it is preferable to "
"specify a `gear_ratio` if the extruder has a gearing mechanism. We "
"expect the rotation_distance in the example configs to correlate with"
" the circumference of the hobbed gear in the extruder - it is "
"normally in the range of 20 to 35mm. When specifying a `gear_ratio` "
"it is preferable to specify the actual gears on the mechanism (eg, "
"prefer `gear_ratio: 80:20` over `gear_ratio: 4:1`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avoid defining field values that are set to their default value. For "
"example, one should not specify `min_extrude_temp: 170` as that is "
"already the default value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where possible, lines should not exceed 80 columns."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avoid adding attribution or revision messages to the config files. "
"(For example, avoid adding lines like \"this file was created by "
"...\".) Place attribution and change history in the git commit "
"message."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not use any deprecated features in the example config file. The "
"`step_distance` and `pin_map` parameters are deprecated and should "
"not be in any example config file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not disable a default safety system in an example config file. For"
" example, a config should not specify a custom "
"`max_extrude_cross_section`. Do not enable debugging features. For "
"example there should not be a `force_move` config section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Example config files are submitted by creating a github \"pull "
"request\". Please also follow the directions in the [contributing "
"document](CONTRIBUTING.md)."
