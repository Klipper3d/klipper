" would move the tool beyond the range of the printer."

msgid "Mesh Interpolation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While its possible to sample the probed matrix directly using simple "
"bilinear interpolation to determine the Z-Values between probed "
"points, it is often useful to interpolate extra points using more "
"advanced interpolation algorithms to increase mesh density. These "
"algorithms add curvature to the mesh, attempting to simulate the "
"material properties of the bed. Bed Mesh offers lagrange and bicubic "
"interpolation to accomplish this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`mesh_pps: 2,3` *Default Value: 2,2* The `mesh_pps` option is "
"shorthand for Mesh Points Per Segment. This option specifies how many"
" points to interpolate for each segment along the x and y axes. "
"Consider a 'segment' to be the space between each probed point. Like "
"`probe_count`, `mesh_pps` is specified as an x,y integer pair, and "
"also may be specified a single integer that is applied to both axes. "
"In this example there are 4 segments along the X axis and 2 segments "
"along the Y axis. This evaluates to 8 interpolated points along X, 6 "
"interpolated points along Y, which results in a 13x8 mesh. Note that "
"if mesh_pps is set to 0 then mesh interpolation is disabled and the "
"probed matrix will be sampled directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`algorithm: lagrange` *Default Value: lagrange* The algorithm used to"
" interpolate the mesh. May be `lagrange` or `bicubic`. Lagrange "
"interpolation is capped at 6 probed points as oscillation tends to "
"occur with a larger number of samples. Bicubic interpolation requires"
" a minimum of 4 probed points along each axis, if less than 4 points "
"are specified then lagrange sampling is forced. If `mesh_pps` is set "
"to 0 then this value is ignored as no mesh interpolation is done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`bicubic_tension: 0.2` *Default Value: 0.2* If the `algorithm` option"
" is set to bicubic it is possible to specify the tension value. The "
"higher the tension the more slope is interpolated. Be careful when "
"adjusting this, as higher values also create more overshoot, which "
"will result in interpolated values higher or lower than your probed "
"points."

msgid "Move Splitting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bed Mesh works by intercepting gcode move commands and applying a "
"transform to their Z coordinate. Long moves must be and split into "
"smaller moves to correctly follow the shape of the bed. The options "
"below control the splitting behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`move_check_distance: 5` *Default Value: 5* The minimum distance to "
"check for the desired change in Z before performing a split. In this "
"example, a move longer than 5mm will be traversed by the algorithm. "
"Each 5mm a mesh Z lookup will occur, comparing it with the Z value of"
" the previous move. If the delta meets the threshold set by "
"`split_delta_z`, the move will be split and traversal will continue. "
"This process repeats until the end of the move is reached, where a "
"final adjustment will be applied. Moves shorter than the "
"`move_check_distance` have the correct Z adjustment applied directly "
"to the move without traversal or splitting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`split_delta_z: .025` *Default Value: .025* As mentioned above, this "
"is the minimum deviation required to trigger a move split. In this "
"example, any Z value with a deviation +/- .025mm will trigger a "
"split."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally the default values for these options are sufficient, in "
"fact the default value of 5mm for the `move_check_distance` may be "
"overkill. However an advanced user may wish to experiment with these "
"options in an effort to squeeze out the optimial first layer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mesh Fade"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When \"fade\" is enabled Z adjustment is phased out over a distance "
"defined by the configuration. This is accomplished by applying small "
"adjustments to the layer height, either increasing or decreasing "
"depending on the shape of the bed. When fade has completed, Z "
"adjustment is no longer applied, allowing the top of the print to be "
"flat rather than mirror the shape of the bed. Fade also may have some"
" undesirable traits, if you fade too quickly it can result in visible"
" artifacts on the print. Also, if your bed is significantly warped, "
"fade can shrink or stretch the Z height of the print. As such, fade "
"is disabled by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`fade_start: 1` *Default Value: 1* The Z height in which to start "
"phasing out adjustment. It is a good idea to get a few layers down "
"before starting the fade process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`fade_end: 10` *Default Value: 0* The Z height in which fade should "
"complete. If this value is lower than `fade_start` then fade is "
"disabled. This value may be adjusted depending on how warped the "
"print surface is. A significantly warped surface should fade out over"
" a longer distance. A near flat surface may be able to reduce this "
"value to phase out more quickly. 10mm is a sane value to begin with "
"if using the default value of 1 for `fade_start`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`fade_target: 0` *Default Value: The average Z value of the mesh* The"
" `fade_target` can be thought of as an additional Z offset applied to"
" the entire bed after fade completes. Generally speaking we would "
"like this value to be 0, however there are circumstances where it "
"should not be. For example, lets assume your homing position on the "
"bed is an outlier, its .2 mm lower than the average probed height of "
"the bed. If the `fade_target` is 0, fade will shrink the print by an "
"average of .2 mm across the bed. By setting the `fade_target` to .2, "
"the homed area will expand by .2 mm, however the rest of the bed will"
" have an accurately sized. Generally its a good idea to leave "
"`fade_target` out of the configuration so the average height of the "
"mesh is used, however it may be desirable to manually adjust the fade"
" target if one wants to print on a specific portion of the bed."

msgid "The Relative Reference Index"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most probes are suceptible to drift, ie: inaccuracies in probing "
"introduced by heat or interference. This can make calculating the "
"probe's z-offset challenging, particuarly at different bed "
"temperatures. As such, some printers use an endstop for homing the Z "
"axis, and a probe for calibrating the mesh. These printers can "
"benefit from configuring the relative reference index."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`relative_reference_index: 7` *Default Value: None (disabled)* When "
"the probed points are generated they are each assigned an index. You "
"can look up this index in klippy.log or by using BED_MESH_OUTPUT (see"
" the section on Bed Mesh GCodes below for more information). If you "
"assign an index to the `relative_reference_index` option, the value "
"probed at this coordinate will replace the probe's z_offset. This "
"effectively makes this coordinate the \"zero\" reference for the "
"mesh."

msgid ""
"When using the relative reference index, you should choose the index "
"nearest to the spot on the bed where Z endstop calibration was done. "

msgid "Faulty Regions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible for some areas of a bed to report inaccurate results "
"when probing due to a \"fault\" at specific locations. The best "
"example of this are beds with series of integrated magnets used to "
"retain removable steel sheets. The magnetic field at and around these"
" magnets may cause an inductive probe to trigger at a distance higher"
" or lower than it would otherwise, resulting in a mesh that does not "
"accurately represent the surface at these locations. **Note: This "
"should not be confused with probe location bias, which produces "
"inaccurate results across the entire bed.**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `faulty_region` options may be configured to compensate for this "
"affect. If a generated point lies within a faulty region bed mesh "

msgstr ""

"`faulty_region_{1...99}_min` `faulty_region_{1..99}_max` *Default "
