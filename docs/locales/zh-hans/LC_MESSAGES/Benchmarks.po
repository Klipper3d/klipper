"This section describes the mechanism used to generate the Klipper "
"micro-controller step rate benchmarks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The primary goal of the benchmarks is to provide a consistent "
"mechanism for measuring the impact of coding changes within the "
"software. A secondary goal is to provide high-level metrics for "
"comparing the performance between chips and between software "
"platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The step rate benchmark is designed to find the maximum stepping rate"
" that the hardware and software can reach. This benchmark stepping "
"rate is not achievable in day-to-day use as Klipper needs to perform "
"other tasks (eg, mcu/host communication, temperature reading, endstop"
" checking) in any real-world usage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, the pins for the benchmark tests are chosen to flash LEDs"
" or other innocuous pins. **Always verify that it is safe to drive "
"the configured pins prior to running a benchmark.** It is not "
"recommended to drive an actual stepper during a benchmark."

"The test is performed using the console.py tool (described in "
"[Debugging.md](Debugging.md)). The micro-controller is configured for"
" the particular hardware platform (see below) and then the following "
"is cut-and-paste into the console.py terminal window:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above tests three steppers simultaneously stepping. If running "
"the above results in a \"Rescheduled timer in the past\" or \"Stepper"
" too far in past\" error then it indicates the `ticks` parameter is "
"too low (it results in a stepping rate that is too fast). The goal is"
" to find the lowest setting of the ticks parameter that reliably "
"results in a successful completion of the test. It should be possible"
" to bisect the ticks parameter until a stable value is found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On a failure, one can copy-and-paste the following to clear the error"
" in preparation for the next test:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To obtain the single stepper and dual stepper benchmarks, the same "
"configuration sequence is used, but only the first block (for the "
"single stepper case) or first two blocks (for the dual stepper case) "
"of the above test is cut-and-paste into the console.py window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To produce the benchmarks found in the Features.md document, the "
"total number of steps per second is calculated by multiplying the "
"number of active steppers with the nominal mcu frequency and dividing"
" by the final ticks parameter. The results are rounded to the nearest"
" K. For example, with three active steppers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Benchmarks may be run with the micro-controller code compiled using a"
" \"step pulse duration\" of zero (the tables below report this as "
"\"no delay\"). This configuration is believed to be valid in real-"
