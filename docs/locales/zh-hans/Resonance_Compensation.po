"EI shaper may be more suited for bed slinger printers (if the "

msgstr ""

"Due to the nature of delta kinematics, resonance frequencies can "

"shaper can be a better fit for delta printers rather than MZV or ZV, "

"sufficiently large (more than 50-60 Hz), then one can even attempt to"
" test 2HUMP_EI shaper (by running the suggested test above with "

"on the resonance frequency and the input shaper you chose (e.g. EI "
"shaper creates more smoothing than MZV), input shaping may cause too "
"much smoothing and rounding of the parts. So, max_accel should be "
"chosen such as to prevent that. Another parameter that can impact "
"smoothing is `square_corner_velocity`, so it is not advisable to "
"increase it above the default 5 mm/sec to prevent increased "

"A note on vibration reduction: the values in the table above are "
"approximate. If the damping ratio of the printer is known for each "
"axis, the shaper can be configured more precisely and it will then "
"reduce the resonances in a bit wider range of frequencies. However, "
"the damping ratio is usually unknown and is hard to estimate without "
"a special equipment, so Klipper uses 0.1 value by default, which is a"
" good all-round value. The frequency ranges in the table cover a "
"number of different possible damping ratios around that value "
"(approx. from 0.05 to 0.2)."

"Shaper duration affects the smoothing in parts - the larger it is, "
"the more smooth the parts are. This dependency is not linear, but can"
" give a sense of which shapers 'smooth' more for the same frequency. "
"The ordering by smoothing is like this: ZV < MZV < ZVD ≈ EI < "
"2HUMP_EI < 3HUMP_EI. Also, it is rarely practical to set shaper_freq "
"= resonance freq for shapers 2HUMP_EI and 3HUMP_EI (they should be "
"used to reduce vibrations for several frequencies)."

msgid ""
"One can estimate a range of frequencies in which the shaper reduces "
"vibrations. For example, MZV with shaper_freq = 35 Hz reduces "
"vibrations to 5% for frequencies [33.6, 36.4] Hz. 3HUMP_EI with "
"shaper_freq = 50 Hz reduces vibrations to 5% in range [27.5, 75] Hz."

"One can use this table to check which shaper they should be using if "
"they need to reduce vibrations at several frequencies. For example, "
"if one has resonances at 35 Hz and 60 Hz on the same axis: a) EI "
"shaper needs to have shaper_freq = 35 / (1 - 0.2) = 43.75 Hz, and it "
"will reduce resonances until 43.75 * (1 + 0.2) = 52.5 Hz, so it is "
"not sufficient; b) 2HUMP_EI shaper needs to have shaper_freq = 35 / "
"(1 - 0.35) = 53.85 Hz and will reduce vibrations until 53.85 * (1 + "
"0.35) = 72.7 Hz - so this is an acceptable configuration. Always try "
"to use as high shaper_freq as possible for a given shaper (perhaps "
"with some safety margin, so in this example shaper_freq ≈ 50-52 Hz "
"would work best), and try to use a shaper with as small shaper "
"duration as possible."

"If one needs to reduce vibrations at several very different "
"frequencies (say, 30 Hz and 100 Hz), they may see that the table "
"above does not provide enough information. In this case one may have "
"more luck with [scripts/graph_shaper.py](../scripts/graph_shaper.py) "
"script, which is more flexible."
