msgid "G-Code Macro Naming"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Case is not important for the G-Code macro name - MY_MACRO and "
"my_macro will evaluate the same and may be called in either upper or "
"lower case. If any numbers are used in the macro name then they must "
"all be at the end of the name (eg, TEST_MACRO25 is valid, but "
"MACRO25_TEST3 is not)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Formatting of G-Code in the config"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Indentation is important when defining a macro in the config file. To"
" specify a multi-line G-Code sequence it is important for each line "
"to have proper indentation. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note how the `gcode:` config option always starts at the beginning of"
" the line and subsequent lines in the G-Code macro never start at the"
" beginning."
msgstr ""

msgid "Save/Restore state for G-Code moves"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, the G-Code command language can be challenging to use."
" The standard mechanism to move the toolhead is via the `G1` command "
"(the `G0` command is an alias for `G1` and it can be used "
"interchangeably with it). However, this command relies on the "
"\"G-Code parsing state\" setup by `M82`, `M83`, `G90`, `G91`, `G92`, "
"and previous `G1` commands. When creating a G-Code macro it is a good"
" idea to always explicitly set the G-Code parsing state prior to "
"issuing a `G1` command. (Otherwise, there is a risk the `G1` command "
"will make an undesirable request.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common way to accomplish that is to wrap the `G1` moves in "
"`SAVE_GCODE_STATE`, `G91`, and `RESTORE_GCODE_STATE`. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `G91` command places the G-Code parsing state into \"relative "
"move mode\" and the `RESTORE_GCODE_STATE` command restores the state "
"to what it was prior to entering the macro. Be sure to specify an "
"explicit speed (via the `F` parameter) on the first `G1` command."
msgstr ""

msgid "Template expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The gcode_macro `gcode:` config section is evaluated using the Jinja2"
" template language. One can evaluate expressions at run-time by "
"wrapping them in `{ }` characters or use conditional statements "
"wrapped in `{% %}`. See the [Jinja2 "
"documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/) for "
"further information on the syntax."
msgstr ""

msgid "An example of a complex macro:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Macro parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often useful to inspect parameters passed to the macro when it "
"is called. These parameters are available via the `params` pseudo-"
"variable. For example, if the macro:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"were invoked as `SET_PERCENT VALUE=.2` it would evaluate to `M117 Now"
" at 20%`. Note that parameter names are always in upper-case when "
"evaluated in the macro and are always passed as strings. If "
"performing math then they must be explicitly converted to integers or"
" floats."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's common to use the Jinja2 `set` directive to use a default "
"parameter and assign the result to a local name. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The \"printer\" Variable"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to inspect (and alter) the current state of the "
"printer via the `printer` pseudo-variable. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Important! Macros are first evaluated in entirety and only then are "
"the resulting commands executed. If a macro issues a command that "
"alters the state of the printer, the results of that state change "
"will not be visible during the evaluation of the macro. This can also"
" result in subtle behavior when a macro generates commands that call "
"other macros, as the called macro is evaluated when it is invoked "
"(which is after the entire evaluation of the calling macro)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By convention, the name immediately following `printer` is the name "
"of a config section. So, for example, `printer.fan` refers to the fan"
" object created by the `[fan]` config section. There are some "
"exceptions to this rule - notably the `gcode_move` and `toolhead` "
"objects. If the config section contains spaces in it, then one can "
"access it via the `[ ]` accessor - for example: "
"`printer[\"generic_heater my_chamber_heater\"].temperature`."
