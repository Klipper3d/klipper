msgid "Packaging klipper"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper is somewhat of a packaging anomaly among python programs, as "
"it doesn't use setuptools to build and install. Some notes regarding "
"how best to package it are as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "C modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper uses a C module to handle some kinematics calculations more "
"quickly. This module needs to be compiled at packaging time to avoid "
"introducing a runtime dependency on a compiler. To compile the C "
"module, run `python2 klippy/chelper/__init__.py`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compiling python code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many distributions have a policy of compiling all python code before "
"packaging to improve startup time. You can do this by running "
"`python2 -m compileall klippy`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Versioning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are building a package of Klipper from git, it is usual "
"practice not to ship a .git directory, so the versioning must be "
"handled without git. To do this, use the script shipped in "
"`scripts/make_version.py` which should be run as follows: `python2 "
"scripts/make_version.py YOURDISTRONAME > klippy/.version`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sample packaging script"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"klipper-git is packaged for Arch Linux, and has a PKGBUILD (package "
"build script) available at "
"https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=klipper-git."
