"This document provides an overview of how Klipper implements robot "
"motion (its [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics)). "
"The contents may be of interest to both developers interested in "
"working on the Klipper software as well as users interested in better"
" understanding the mechanics of their machines."

msgid "Acceleration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper implements a constant acceleration scheme whenever the print "
"head changes velocity - the velocity is gradually changed to the new "
"speed instead of suddenly jerking to it. Klipper always enforces "
"acceleration between the tool head and the print. The filament "
"leaving the extruder can be quite fragile - rapid jerks and/or "
"extruder flow changes lead to poor quality and poor bed adhesion. "
"Even when not extruding, if the print head is at the same level as "
"the print then rapid jerking of the head can cause disruption of "
"recently deposited filament. Limiting speed changes of the print head"
" (relative to the print) reduces risks of disrupting the print."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also important to limit acceleration so that the stepper motors"
" do not skip or put excessive stress on the machine. Klipper limits "
"the torque on each stepper by virtue of limiting the acceleration of "
"the print head. Enforcing acceleration at the print head naturally "
"also limits the torque of the steppers that move the print head (the "
"inverse is not always true)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper implements constant acceleration. The key formula for "
"constant acceleration is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Trapezoid generator"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper uses a traditional \"trapezoid generator\" to model the "
"motion of each move - each move has a start speed, it accelerates to "
"a cruising speed at constant acceleration, it cruises at a constant "
"speed, and then decelerates to the end speed using constant "
"acceleration."
msgstr ""

msgid "![trapezoid](img/trapezoid.svg.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's called a \"trapezoid generator\" because a velocity diagram of "
"the move looks like a trapezoid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The cruising speed is always greater than or equal to both the start "
"speed and the end speed. The acceleration phase may be of zero "
"duration (if the start speed is equal to the cruising speed), the "
"cruising phase may be of zero duration (if the move immediately "
"starts decelerating after acceleration), and/or the deceleration "
"phase may be of zero duration (if the end speed is equal to the "
"cruising speed)."

msgid "Look-ahead"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"look-ahead\" system is used to determine cornering speeds "
"between moves."
msgstr ""

msgid "Consider the following two moves contained on an XY plane:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![corner](img/corner.svg.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above situation it is possible to fully decelerate after the "
"first move and then fully accelerate at the start of the next move, "
"but that is not ideal as all that acceleration and deceleration would"
" greatly increase the print time and the frequent changes in extruder"
" flow would result in poor print quality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To solve this, the \"look-ahead\" mechanism queues multiple incoming "
"moves and analyzes the angles between moves to determine a reasonable"
" speed that can be obtained during the \"junction\" between two "
"moves. If the next move is nearly in the same direction then the head"
" need only slow down a little (if at all)."
msgstr ""

msgid "![lookahead](img/lookahead.svg.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, if the next move forms an acute angle (the head is going to "
"travel in nearly a reverse direction on the next move) then only a "
"small junction speed is permitted."
msgstr ""

msgid "![lookahead](img/lookahead-slow.svg.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The junction speeds are determined using \"approximated centripetal "
"acceleration\". Best [described by the "
"author](https://onehossshay.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/improving_grbl_cornering_algorithm/)."
" However, in Klipper, junction speeds are configured by specifying "
"the desired speed that a 90° corner should have (the \"square corner "
"velocity\"), and the junction speeds for other angles are derived "
"from that."
msgstr ""

msgid "Key formula for look-ahead:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Smoothed look-ahead"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper also implements a mechanism for smoothing out the motions of "
"short \"zigzag\" moves. Consider the following moves:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![zigzag](img/zigzag.svg.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above, the frequent changes from acceleration to deceleration "
"can cause the machine to vibrate which causes stress on the machine "
"and increases the noise. To reduce this, Klipper tracks both regular "
"move acceleration as well as a virtual \"acceleration to "
"deceleration\" rate. Using this system, the top speed of these short "
"\"zigzag\" moves are limited to smooth out the printer motion:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![smoothed](img/smoothed.svg.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifically, the code calculates what the velocity of each move "
"would be if it were limited to this virtual \"acceleration to "
"deceleration\" rate (half the normal acceleration rate by default). "
"In the above picture the dashed gray lines represent this virtual "
"acceleration rate for the first move. If a move can not reach its "
"full cruising speed using this virtual acceleration rate then its top"
" speed is reduced to the maximum speed it could obtain at this "
"virtual acceleration rate. For most moves the limit will be at or "
"above the move's existing limits and no change in behavior is "
"induced. For short zigzag moves, however, this limit reduces the top "
"speed. Note that it does not change the actual acceleration within "
"the move - the move continues to use the normal acceleration scheme "
"up to its adjusted top-speed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Generating steps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the look-ahead process completes, the print head movement for "
"the given move is fully known (time, start position, end position, "
"velocity at each point) and it is possible to generate the step times"
" for the move. This process is done within \"kinematic classes\" in "
"the Klipper code. Outside of these kinematic classes, everything is "
"tracked in millimeters, seconds, and in cartesian coordinate space. "
"It's the task of the kinematic classes to convert from this generic "
"coordinate system to the hardware specifics of the particular "
"printer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper uses an [iterative "
"solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithm) to "
"generate the step times for each stepper. The code contains the "
"formulas to calculate the ideal cartesian coordinates of the head at "
"each moment in time, and it has the kinematic formulas to calculate "
"the ideal stepper positions based on those cartesian coordinates. "
"With these formulas, Klipper can determine the ideal time that the "
"stepper should be at each step position. The given steps are then "
"scheduled at these calculated times."
msgstr ""

"The key formula to determine how far a move should travel under "
"constant acceleration is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "and the key formula for movement with constant velocity is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The key formulas for determining the cartesian coordinate of a move "
"given a move distance is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cartesian Robots"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generating steps for cartesian printers is the simplest case. The "
"movement on each axis is directly related to the movement in "
"cartesian space."
msgstr ""

msgid "Key formulas:"
msgstr ""

msgid "CoreXY Robots"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generating steps on a CoreXY machine is only a little more complex "
"than basic cartesian robots. The key formulas are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Delta Robots"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Step generation on a delta robot is based on Pythagoras's theorem:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Stepper motor acceleration limits"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With delta kinematics it is possible for a move that is accelerating "
"in cartesian space to require an acceleration on a particular stepper"
" motor greater than the move's acceleration. This can occur when a "
"stepper arm is more horizontal than vertical and the line of movement"
" passes near that stepper's tower. Although these moves could require"
" a stepper motor acceleration greater than the printer's maximum "
"configured move acceleration, the effective mass moved by that "
"stepper would be smaller. Thus the higher stepper acceleration does "
"not result in significantly higher stepper torque and it is therefore"
" considered harmless."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, to avoid extreme cases, Klipper enforces a maximum ceiling "
"on stepper acceleration of three times the printer's configured "
"maximum move acceleration. (Similarly, the maximum velocity of the "
"stepper is limited to three times the maximum move velocity.) In "
"order to enforce this limit, moves at the extreme edge of the build "
"envelope (where a stepper arm may be nearly horizontal) will have a "
"lower maximum acceleration and velocity."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extruder kinematics"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper implements extruder motion in its own kinematic class. Since "
"the timing and speed of each print head movement is fully known for "
"each move, it's possible to calculate the step times for the extruder"
" independently from the step time calculations of the print head "
"movement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Basic extruder movement is simple to calculate. The step time "
"generation uses the same formulas that cartesian robots use:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pressure advance"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Experimentation has shown that it's possible to improve the modeling "
"of the extruder beyond the basic extruder formula. In the ideal case,"
" as an extrusion move progresses, the same volume of filament should "
"be deposited at each point along the move and there should be no "
"volume extruded after the move. Unfortunately, it's common to find "
"that the basic extrusion formulas cause too little filament to exit "
"the extruder at the start of extrusion moves and for excess filament "
"to extrude after extrusion ends. This is often referred to as "
"\"ooze\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "![ooze](img/ooze.svg.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"pressure advance\" system attempts to account for this by using"
" a different model for the extruder. Instead of naively believing "
"that each mm^3 of filament fed into the extruder will result in that "
"amount of mm^3 immediately exiting the extruder, it uses a model "
"based on pressure. Pressure increases when filament is pushed into "
"the extruder (as in [Hooke's "
"law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law)) and the pressure "
"necessary to extrude is dominated by the flow rate through the nozzle"
" orifice (as in [Poiseuille's "
"law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poiseuille_law)). The key idea is "
"that the relationship between filament, pressure, and flow rate can "
"be modeled using a linear coefficient:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the [pressure advance](Pressure_Advance.md) document for "
"information on how to find this pressure advance coefficient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The basic pressure advance formula can cause the extruder motor to "
"make sudden velocity changes. Klipper implements \"smoothing\" of the"
" extruder movement to avoid this."
msgstr ""

msgid "![pressure-advance](img/pressure-velocity.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above graph shows an example of two extrusion moves with a non-"
"zero cornering velocity between them. Note that the pressure advance "
"system causes additional filament to be pushed into the extruder "
"during acceleration. The higher the desired filament flow rate, the "
"more filament must be pushed in during acceleration to account for "
"pressure. During head deceleration the extra filament is retracted "
"(the extruder will have a negative velocity)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"smoothing\" is implemented using a weighted average of the "
"extruder position over a small time period (as specified by the "
"`pressure_advance_smooth_time` config parameter). This averaging can "
"span multiple g-code moves. Note how the extruder motor will start "
"moving prior to the nominal start of the first extrusion move and "
"will continue to move after the nominal end of the last extrusion "
"move."
