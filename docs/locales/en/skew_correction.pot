"Software based skew correction can help resolve dimensional "
"inaccuracies resulting from a printer assembly that is not perfectly "
"square. Note that if your printer is significantly skewed it is "
"strongly recommended to first use mechanical means to get your "
"printer as square as possible prior to applying software based "
"correction."

msgid "Print a Calibration Object"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first step in correcting skew is to print a [calibration "
"object](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2563185/files) along the "
"plane you want to correct. There is also a [calibration "
"object](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2972743) that includes all "
"planes in one model. You want the object oriented so that corner A is"
" toward the origin of the plane."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure that no skew correction is applied during this print. You "
"may do this by either removing the [skew_correction] module from "
"printer.cfg or by issuing a `SET_SKEW CLEAR=1` gcode."
msgstr ""

msgid "Take your measurements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The [skew_correcton] module requires 3 measurements for each plane "
"you want to correct; the length from Corner A to Corner C, the length"
" from Corner B to Corner D, and the length from corner A to corner D."
" When measuring length AD do not include the flats on the corners "
"that some test objects provide."

msgid "Configure your skew"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure [skew_correction] is in printer.cfg. You may now use the "
"`SET_SKEW` gcode to configure skew_correcton. For example, if your "
"measured lengths along XY are as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`SET_SKEW` can be used to configure skew correction for the XY plane."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may also add measurements for XZ and YZ to the gcode:"

"The [skew_correction] module also supports profile management in a "
"manner similar to [bed_mesh]. After setting skew using the `SET_SKEW`"
" gcode, you may use the `SKEW_PROFILE` gcode to save it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After this command you will be prompted to issue a `SAVE_CONFIG` "
"gcode to save the profile to persistent storage. If no profile is "
"named `my_skew_profile` then a new profile will be created. If the "
"named profile exists it will be overwritten."

msgid "Verifying your correction"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After skew_correction has been configured you may reprint the "
"calibration part with correction enabled. Use the following gcode to "
"check your skew on each plane. The results should be lower than those"
" reported via `GET_CURRENT_SKEW`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Caveats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to the nature of skew correction it is recommended to configure "
"skew in your start gcode, after homing and any kind of movement that "
"travels near the edge of the print area such as a purge or nozzle "
"wipe. You may use use the `SET_SKEW` or `SKEW_PROFILE` gcodes to "
"accomplish this. It is also recommended to issue a `SET_SKEW CLEAR=1`"
" in your end gcode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that it is possible for [skew_correction] to generate a "
"correction that moves the tool beyond the printer's boundries on the "
"X and/or Y axes. It is recommended to arrange parts away from the "
"edges when using [skew_correction]."
