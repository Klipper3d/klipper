"Many of today's popular controller boards ship with a bootloader "
"capable of updating firmware via SD Card. While this is convenient in"
" many circumstances, these bootloaders typically provide no other way"
" to update firmware. This can be a nuisance if your board is mounted "
"in a location that is difficult to access or if you need to update "
"firmware often. After Klipper has been initially flashed to a "
"controller it is possible to transfer new firmware to the SD Card and"
" initiate the flashing procedure via ssh."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical Upgrade Procedure"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The procedure for updating MCU firmware using the SD Card is similar "
"to that of other methods. Instead of using `make flash` it is "
"necessary to run a helper script, `flash-sdcard.sh`. Updating a "
"BigTreeTech SKR 1.3 might look like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is up to the user to determine the device location and board name."
" If a user needs to flash multiple boards, `flash-sdcard.sh` (or "
"`make flash` if appropriate) should be run for each board prior to "
"restarting the Klipper service."
msgstr ""

msgid "Supported boards can be listed with the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do not see your board listed it may be necessary to add a new "
"board definition as [described below](#board-definitions)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advanced Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above commands assume that your MCU connects at the default baud "
"rate of 250000 and the firmware is located at "
"`~/klipper/out/klipper.bin`. The `flash-sdcard.sh` script provides "
"options for changing these defaults. All options can be viewed by the"
" help screen:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your board is flashed with firmware that connects at a custom baud"
" rate it is possible to upgrade by specifying the `-b` option:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wish to flash a build of Klipper located somewhere other than "
"the default location it can be done by specifying the `-f` option:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that when upgrading a MKS Robin E3 it is not necessary to "
"manually run `update_mks_robin.py` and supply the resulting binary to"
" `flash-sdcard.sh`. This procedure is automated during the upload "
"process."
msgstr ""

msgid "Caveats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the introduction, this method only works for "
"upgrading firmware. The initial flashing procedure must be done "
"manually per the instructions that apply to your controller board."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While it is possible to flash a build that changes the Serial Baud or"
" connection interface (ie: from USB to UART), verification will "
"always fail as the script will be unable to reconnect to the MCU to "
"verify the current version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only boards that use SPI for SD Card communication are supported. "
"Boards that use SDIO, such as the Flymaker Flyboard and MKS Robin "
"Nano V1/V2, will not work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Board Definitions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most common boards should be available, however it is possible to add"
" a new board definition if necessary. Board definitions are located "
"in `~/klipper/scripts/spi_flash/board_defs.py`. The definitions are "
"stored in dictionary, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The following fields may be specified:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`mcu`: The mcu type. This can be retrevied after configuring the "
"build via `make menuconfig` by running `cat .config | grep "
"CONFIG_MCU`. This field is required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`spi_bus`: The SPI bus connected to the SD Card. This should be "
"retreived from the board's schematic. This field is required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`cs_pin`: The Chip Select Pin connected to the SD Card. This should "
"be retreived from the board schematic. This field is required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`firmware_path`: The path on the SD Card where firmware should be "
"transferred. The default is `firmware.bin`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`current_firmware_path` The path on the SD Card where the renamed "
"firmware file is located after a successful flash. The default is "
"`firmware.cur`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If software SPI is required the `spi_bus` field should be set to "
"`swspi` and the following additional field should be specified:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`spi_pins`: This should be 3 comma separated pins that are connected "
"to the SD Card in the format of `miso,mosi,sclk`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It should be exceedingly rare that Software SPI is necessary, "
"typically only boards with design errors will require it. The `btt-"
"skr-pro` board definition provides an example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prior to creating a new board definition one should check to see if "
"an existing board definition meets the criteria necessary for the new"
" board. If this is the case, a `BOARD_ALIAS` may be specified. For "
"example, the following alias may be added to specify `my-new-board` "
"as an alias for `generic-lpc1768`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need a new board definition and you are uncomfortable with the"
" procedure outlined above it is recommended that you request one in "
"the [Klipper Community Discord](Contact.md#discord)."
