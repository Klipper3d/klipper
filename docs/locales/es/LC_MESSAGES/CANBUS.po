msgid "This document describes Klipper's CAN bus support."
msgstr ""

msgid "Device Hardware"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper currently only supports CAN on stm32 chips. In addition, the "
"micro-controller chip must support CAN and it must be on a board that"
" has a CAN transceiver."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To compile for CAN, run \"make menuconfig\" and select \"CAN bus\" as"
" the communication interface. Finally, compile the micro-controller "
"code and flash it to the target board."
msgstr ""

msgid "Host Hardware"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to use a CAN bus, it is necessary to have a host adapter. "
"There are currently two common options:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a [Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN "
"hat](https://www.waveshare.com/rs485-can-hat.htm) or one of its many "
"clones."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a USB CAN adapter (for example [https://hacker-"
"gadgets.com/product/cantact-usb-can-adapter/](https://hacker-"
"gadgets.com/product/cantact-usb-can-adapter/)). There are many "
"different USB to CAN adapters available - when choosing one, we "
"recommend verifying it can run the [candlelight "
"firmware](https://github.com/candle-usb/candleLight_fw). "
"(Unfortunately, we've found some USB adapters run defective firmware "
"and are locked down, so verify before purchasing.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also necessary to configure the host operating system to use "
"the adapter. This is typically done by creating a new file named "
"`/etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` with the following contents:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the \"Raspberry Pi CAN hat\" also requires [changes to "
"config.txt](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Terminating Resistors"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A CAN bus should have two 120 ohm resistors between the CANH and CANL"
" wires. Ideally, one resistor located at each the end of the bus."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that some devices have a builtin 120 ohm resistor (for example, "
"the \"Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN hat\" has a soldered on resistor "
"that can not be easily removed). Some devices do not include a "
"resistor at all. Other devices have a mechanism to select the "
"resistor (typically by connecting a \"pin jumper\"). Be sure to check"
" the schematics of all devices on the CAN bus to verify that there "
"are two and only two 120 Ohm resistors on the bus."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To test that the resistors are correct, one can remove power to the "
"printer and use a multi-meter to check the resistance between the "
"CANH and CANL wires - it should report ~60 ohms on a correctly wired "
"CAN bus."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finding the canbus_uuid for new micro-controllers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each micro-controller on the CAN bus is assigned a unique id based on"
" the factory chip identifier encoded into each micro-controller. To "
"find each micro-controller device id, make sure the hardware is "
"powered and wired correctly, and then run:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If uninitialized CAN devices are detected the above command will "
"report lines like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each device will have a unique identifier. In the above example, "
"`11aa22bb33cc` is the micro-controller's \"canbus_uuid\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the `canbus_query.py` tool will only report uninitialized "
"devices - if Klipper (or a similar tool) configures the device then "
"it will no longer appear in the list."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuring Klipper"
msgstr "Configurar Klipper"

msgid ""
"Update the Klipper [mcu configuration](Config_Reference.md#mcu) to "
"use the CAN bus to communicate with the device - for example:"
msgstr ""
