# Changes

20190310: The [controller_fan] config section now always takes a name
(such as [controller_fan my_controller_fan]).

20190308: The "driver_BLANK_TIME_SELECT" field in [tmc2130] and
[tmc2208] config sections has been renamed to "driver_TBL".

20190308: The [tmc2660] config section has changed. A new
sense_resistor config parameter must now be provided. The meaning of
several of the driver_XXX parameters has changed.

20190228: Users of SPI or I2C on SAMD21 boards must now specify the
bus pins via a [samd_sercom] config section.

20190224: The bed_shape option has been removed from bed_mesh.  The
radius option has been renamed to bed_radius.  Users with round beds
should supply the bed_radius and round_probe_count options.

changed. This is a common setting on Smoothieboards. The new value is
half the old value (88 should be changed to 44, and 90 should be
