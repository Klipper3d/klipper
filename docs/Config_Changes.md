# Configuration Changes

This document covers recent software changes to the config file that
are not backwards compatible. It is a good idea to review this
document when upgrading the Klipper software.

All dates in this document are approximate.

## Changes

20240415: The `on_error_gcode` parameter in the `[virtual_sdcard]`
config section now has a default. If this parameter is not specified
it now defaults to `TURN_OFF_HEATERS`. If the previous behavior is
desired (take no default action on an error during a virtual_sdcard
print) then define `on_error_gcode` with an empty value.

20240313: The `max_accel_to_decel` parameter in the `[printer]` config
section has been deprecated. The `ACCEL_TO_DECEL` parameter of the
`SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT` command has been deprecated. The
`printer.toolhead.max_accel_to_decel` status has been removed. Use the
[minimum_cruise_ratio parameter](./Config_Reference.md#printer)
instead. The deprecated features will be removed in the near future,
and using them in the interim may result in subtly different behavior.

20240215: Several deprecated features have been removed. Using "NTC
100K beta 3950" as a thermistor name has been removed (deprecated on
20211110). The `SYNC_STEPPER_TO_EXTRUDER` and
`SET_EXTRUDER_STEP_DISTANCE` commands have been removed, and the
extruder `shared_heater` config option has been removed (deprecated on
20220210). The bed_mesh `relative_reference_index` option has been
removed (deprecated on 20230619).

20240123: The output_pin SET_PIN CYCLE_TIME parameter has been
removed. Use the new
[pwm_cycle_time](Config_Reference.md#pwm_cycle_time) module if it is
necessary to dynamically change a pwm pin's cycle time.

20240123: The output_pin `maximum_mcu_duration` parameter is
deprecated. Use a [pwm_tool config section](Config_Reference.md#pwm_tool)
instead. The option will be removed in the near future.

20240123: The output_pin `static_value` parameter is deprecated.
Replace with `value` and `shutdown_value` parameters.  The option will
be removed in the near future.

20231216: The `[hall_filament_width_sensor]` is changed to trigger filament runout
when the thickness of the filament exceeds `max_diameter`. The maximum diameter
defaults to `default_nominal_filament_diameter + max_difference`. See
[[hall_filament_width_sensor] configuration
reference](./Config_Reference.md#hall_filament_width_sensor) for more details.

20231207: Several undocumented config parameters in the `[printer]`
config section have been removed (the buffer_time_low,
buffer_time_high, buffer_time_start, and move_flush_time parameters).

20231110: Klipper v0.12.0 released.

20230826: If `safe_distance` is set or calculated to be 0 in `[dual_carriage]`,
the carriages proximity checks will be disabled as per documentation. A user
may wish to configure `safe_distance` explicitly to prevent accidental crashes
of the carriages with each other. Additionally, the homing order of the primary
and the dual carriage is changed in some configurations (certain configurations
when both carriages home in the same direction, see
[[dual_carriage] configuration reference](./Config_Reference.md#dual_carriage)
for more details).

20230810: The flash-sdcard.sh script now supports both variants of the
Bigtreetech SKR-3, STM32H743 and STM32H723. For this, the original tag
of btt-skr-3 now has changed to be either btt-skr-3-h743 or btt-skr-3-h723.

20230729: The exported status for `dual_carriage` is changed. Instead of
exporting `mode` and `active_carriage`, the individual modes for each
carriage are exported as `printer.dual_carriage.carriage_0` and
`printer.dual_carriage.carriage_1`.

20230619: The `relative_reference_index` option has been deprecated
and superceded by the `zero_reference_position` option.  Refer to the
[Bed Mesh Documentation](./Bed_Mesh.md#the-deprecated-relative_reference_index)
for details on how to update the configuration.  With this deprecation
the `RELATIVE_REFERENCE_INDEX` is no longer available as a parameter
for the `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` gcode command.

20230530: The default canbus frequency in "make menuconfig" is
now 1000000. If using canbus and using canbus with some other
frequency is required, then be sure to select "Enable extra low-level
configuration options" and specify the desired "CAN bus speed" in
"make menuconfig" when compiling and flashing the micro-controller.

20230525: `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` command immediately applies input shaper
parameters if `[input_shaper]` was enabled already.

20230407: The `stalled_bytes` counter in the log and in the
`printer.mcu.last_stats` field has been renamed to `upcoming_bytes`.

20230323: On tmc5160 drivers `multistep_filt` is now enabled by default. Set
`driver_MULTISTEP_FILT: False` in the tmc5160 config for the previous behavior.

20230304: The `SET_TMC_CURRENT` command now properly adjusts the globalscaler
register for drivers that have it. This removes a limitation where on tmc5160,
the currents could not be raised higher with `SET_TMC_CURRENT` than the
`run_current` value set in the config file.
However, this has a side effect: After running `SET_TMC_CURRENT`, the stepper
must be held at standstill for >130ms in case StealthChop2 is used so that the
AT#1 calibration gets executed by the driver.

20230202: The format of the `printer.screws_tilt_adjust` status
information has changed. The information is now stored as a dictionary of
screws with the resulting measurements. See the
[status reference](Status_Reference.md#screws_tilt_adjust) for details.

20230201:  The `[bed_mesh]` module no longer loads the `default` profile
on startup.  It is recommended that users who use the `default` profile
add `BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=default` to their `START_PRINT` macro (or
to their slicer's "Start G-Code" configuration when applicable).

20230103: It is now possible with the flash-sdcard.sh script to flash
both variants of the Bigtreetech SKR-2, STM32F407 and STM32F429.
This means that the original tag of btt-skr2 now has changed to either
btt-skr-2-f407 or btt-skr-2-f429.

20221128: Klipper v0.11.0 released.

20221122: Previously, with safe_z_home, it was possible that the
z_hop after the g28 homing would go in the negative z direction.
Now, a z_hop is performed after g28 only if it results in a positive
hop, mirroring the behavior of the z_hop that occurs before
the g28 homing.

20220616: It was previously possible to flash an rp2040 in bootloader
mode by running `make flash FLASH_DEVICE=first`. The equivalent
command is now `make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003`.

20220612: The rp2040 micro-controller now has a workaround for the
"rp2040-e5" USB errata. This should make initial USB connections more
reliable. However, it may result in a change in behavior for the
gpio15 pin. It is unlikely the gpio15 behavior change will be
noticeable.

20220407: The temperature_fan `pid_integral_max` config option has
been removed (it was deprecated on 20210612).

20220407: The default color order for pca9632 LEDs is now "RGBW". Add
an explicit `color_order: RBGW` setting to the pca9632 config section
to obtain the previous behavior.

20220330: The format of the `printer.neopixel.color_data` status
information for neopixel and dotstar modules has changed. The
information is now stored as a list of color lists (instead of a list
of dictionaries). See the [status reference](Status_Reference.md#led)
for details.

20220307: `M73` will no longer set print progress to 0 if `P` is missing.

20220304: There is no longer a default for the `extruder` parameter of
[extruder_stepper](Config_Reference.md#extruder_stepper) config
sections. If desired, specify `extruder: extruder` explicitly to
associate the stepper motor with the "extruder" motion queue at
startup.

20220210: The `SYNC_STEPPER_TO_EXTRUDER` command is deprecated; the
`SET_EXTRUDER_STEP_DISTANCE` command is deprecated; the
[extruder](Config_Reference.md#extruder) `shared_heater` config option
is deprecated. These features will be removed in the near future.
Replace `SET_EXTRUDER_STEP_DISTANCE` with
`SET_EXTRUDER_ROTATION_DISTANCE`. Replace `SYNC_STEPPER_TO_EXTRUDER`
with `SYNC_EXTRUDER_MOTION`. Replace extruder config sections using
`shared_heater` with
[extruder_stepper](Config_Reference.md#extruder_stepper) config
sections and update any activation macros to use
[SYNC_EXTRUDER_MOTION](G-Codes.md#sync_extruder_motion).

20220116: The tmc2130, tmc2208, tmc2209, and tmc2660 `run_current`
calculation code has changed. For some `run_current` settings the
drivers may now be configured differently. This new configuration
should be more accurate, but it may invalidate previous tmc driver
tuning.

20211230: Scripts to tune input shaper (`scripts/calibrate_shaper.py`
and `scripts/graph_accelerometer.py`) were migrated to use Python3
by default. As a result, users must install Python3 versions of certain
packages (e.g. `sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib`) to
continue using these scripts. For more details, refer to
[Software installation](Measuring_Resonances.md#software-installation).
Alternatively, users can temporarily force the execution of these scripts
under Python 2 by explicitly calling Python2 interpretor in the console:
`python2 ~/klipper/scripts/calibrate_shaper.py ...`

20211110: The "NTC 100K beta 3950" temperature sensor is deprecated.
This sensor will be removed in the near future.  Most users will find
the "Generic 3950" temperature sensor more accurate.  To continue to
use the older (typically less accurate) definition, define a custom
[thermistor](Config_Reference.md#thermistor) with `temperature1: 25`,
`resistance1: 100000`, and `beta: 3950`.

20211104: The "step pulse duration" option in "make menuconfig" has
been removed. The default step duration for TMC drivers configured in
UART or SPI mode is now 100ns. A new `step_pulse_duration` setting in
the [stepper config section](Config_Reference.md#stepper) should be
set for all steppers that need a custom pulse duration.

20211102: Several deprecated features have been removed.  The stepper
`step_distance` option has been removed (deprecated on 20201222).  The
`rpi_temperature` sensor alias has been removed (deprecated on
20210219).  The mcu `pin_map` option has been removed (deprecated on
20210325).  The gcode_macro `default_parameter_<name>` and macro
access to command parameters other than via the `params`
pseudo-variable has been removed (deprecated on 20210503).  The heater
`pid_integral_max` option has been removed (deprecated on 20210612).

20210929: Klipper v0.10.0 released.

20210903: The default [`smooth_time`](Config_Reference.md#extruder)
for heaters has changed to 1 second (from 2 seconds).  For most
printers this will result in more stable temperature control.

20210830: The default adxl345 name is now "adxl345".  The default CHIP
parameter for the `ACCELEROMETER_MEASURE` and `ACCELEROMETER_QUERY` is
now also "adxl345".

20210830: The adxl345 ACCELEROMETER_MEASURE command no longer supports
a RATE parameter.  To alter the query rate, update the printer.cfg
file and issue a RESTART command.

20210821: Several config settings in `printer.configfile.settings`
will now be reported as lists instead of raw strings.  If the actual
raw string is desired, use `printer.configfile.config` instead.

20210819: In some cases, a `G28` homing move may end in a position
that is nominally outside the valid movement range.  In rare
situations this may result in confusing "Move out of range" errors
after homing.  If this occurs, change your start scripts to move the
toolhead to a valid position immediately after homing.

20210814: The analog only pseudo-pins on the atmega168 and atmega328
have been renamed from PE0/PE1 to PE2/PE3.

20210720: A controller_fan section now monitors all stepper motors by
default (not just the kinematic stepper motors).  If the previous
behavior is desired, see the `stepper` config option in the
[config reference](Config_Reference.md#controller_fan).

20210703: A `samd_sercom` config section must now specify the sercom
bus it is configuring via the `sercom` option.

20210612: The `pid_integral_max` config option in heater and
temperature_fan sections is deprecated.  The option will be removed in
the near future.

20210503: The gcode_macro `default_parameter_<name>` config option is
deprecated.  Use the `params` pseudo-variable to access macro
parameters.  Other methods for accessing macro parameters will be
removed in the near future.  Most users can replace a
`default_parameter_NAME: VALUE` config option with a line like the
following in the start of the macro: ` {% set NAME =
params.NAME|default(VALUE)|float %}`.  See the [Command Templates
document](Command_Templates.md#macro-parameters) for examples.

20210430: The SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT (and M204) command may now set a
velocity, acceleration, and square_corner_velocity larger than the
specified values in the config file.

20210325: Support for the `pin_map` config option is deprecated. Use
the [sample-aliases.cfg](../config/sample-aliases.cfg) file to
translate to the actual micro-controller pin names. The `pin_map`
config option will be removed in the near future.

20210313: Klipper's support for micro-controllers that communicate
with CAN bus has changed. If using CAN bus then all micro-controllers
must be reflashed and the
[Klipper configuration must be updated](CANBUS.md).

20210310: The TMC2660 default for driver_SFILT has been changed from 1
to 0.

20210227: TMC stepper motor drivers in UART or SPI mode are now
queried once per second whenever they are enabled - if the driver can
not be contacted or if the driver reports an error, then Klipper will
transition to a shutdown state.

20210219: The `rpi_temperature` module has been renamed to
`temperature_host`.  Replace any occurrences of `sensor_type:
rpi_temperature` with `sensor_type: temperature_host`.  The path to
the temperature file may be specified in the `sensor_path` config
variable.  The `rpi_temperature` name is deprecated and will be
removed in the near future.

20210201: The `TEST_RESONANCES` command will now disable input shaping
if it was previously enabled (and re-enable it after the test). In order
to override this behavior and keep the input shaping enabled, one can
pass an additional parameter `INPUT_SHAPING=1` to the command.

20210201: The `ACCELEROMETER_MEASURE` command will now append the name
of the accelerometer chip to the output file name if the chip was given
a name in the corresponding adxl345 section of the printer.cfg.

20201222: The `step_distance` setting in the stepper config sections
is deprecated.  It is advised to update the config to use the
[`rotation_distance`](Rotation_Distance.md) setting.  Support for
`step_distance` will be removed in the near future.

20201218: The `endstop_phase` setting in the endstop_phase module has
been replaced with `trigger_phase`. If using the endstop phases module
then it will be necessary to convert to
[`rotation_distance`](Rotation_Distance.md) and recalibrate any
endstop phases by running the ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE command.

20201218: Rotary delta and polar printers must now specify a
`gear_ratio` for their rotary steppers, and they may no longer specify
a `step_distance` parameter.  See the
[config reference](Config_Reference.md#stepper) for the format of the
new gear_ratio paramter.

20201213: It is not valid to specify a Z "position_endstop" when using
"probe:z_virtual_endstop".  An error will now be raised if a Z
"position_endstop" is specified with "probe:z_virtual_endstop".
Remove the Z "position_endstop" definition to fix the error.

20201120: The `[board_pins]` config section now specifies the mcu name
in an explicit `mcu:` parameter.  If using board_pins for a secondary
mcu, then the config must be updated to specify that name.  See the
[config reference](Config_Reference.md#board_pins) for further
details.

20201112: The time reported by `print_stats.print_duration` has
changed.  The duration prior to the first detected extrusion is
now excluded.

20201029: The neopixel `color_order_GRB` config option has been
removed. If necessary, update the config to set the new `color_order`
option to RGB, GRB, RGBW, or GRBW.

20201029: The serial option in the mcu config section no longer
defaults to /dev/ttyS0.  In the rare situation where /dev/ttyS0 is the
desired serial port, it must be specified explicitly.

20201020: Klipper v0.9.0 released.

20200902: The RTD resistance-to-temperature calculation for MAX31865
converters has been corrected to not read low.  If you are using such a
device, you should recalibrate your print temperature and PID settings.

20200816: The gcode macro `printer.gcode` object has been renamed to
`printer.gcode_move`.  Several undocumented variables in
`printer.toolhead` and `printer.gcode` have been removed.  See
docs/Command_Templates.md for a list of available template variables.

20200816: The gcode macro "action_" system has changed.  Replace any
calls to `printer.gcode.action_emergency_stop()` with
`action_emergency_stop()`, `printer.gcode.action_respond_info()` with
`action_respond_info()`, and `printer.gcode.action_respond_error()`
with `action_raise_error()`.

20200809: The menu system has been rewritten. If the menu has been
customized then it will be necessary to update to the new
configuration. See config/example-menu.cfg for configuration details
and see klippy/extras/display/menu.cfg for examples.

20200731:  The behavior of the `progress` attribute reported by
the `virtual_sdcard` printer object has changed.  Progress is no
longer reset to 0 when a print is paused.  It will now always report
progress based on the internal file position, or 0 if no file is
currently loaded.

20200725: The servo `enable` config parameter and the SET_SERVO
`ENABLE` parameter have been removed.  Update any macros to use
`SET_SERVO SERVO=my_servo WIDTH=0` to disable a servo.

20200608: The LCD display support has changed the name of some
internal "glyphs".  If a custom display layout was implemented it may
be necessary to update to the latest glyph names (see
klippy/extras/display/display.cfg for a list of available glyphs).

20200606: The pin names on linux mcu have changed. Pins now have names
of the form `gpiochip<chipid>/gpio<gpio>`.  For gpiochip0 you can also
use a short `gpio<gpio>`.  For example, what was previously referred
to as `P20` now becomes `gpio20` or `gpiochip0/gpio20`.

20200603: The default 16x4 LCD layout will no longer show the
estimated time remaining in a print.  (Only the elapsed time will be
shown.)  If the old behavior is desired one can customize the menu
display with that information (see the description of display_data in
config/example-extras.cfg for details).

20200531: The default USB vendor/product id is now 0x1d50/0x614e.
These new ids are reserved for Klipper (thanks to the openmoko
project). This change should not require any config changes, but the
new ids may appear in system logs.

20200524: The default value for the tmc5160 pwm_freq field is now zero
(instead of one).

20200425: The gcode_macro command template variable `printer.heater`
was renamed to `printer.heaters`.

20200313: The default lcd layout for multi-extruder printers with a
16x4 screen has changed.  The single extruder screen layout is now the
default and it will show the currently active extruder.  To use the
previous display layout set "display_group: _multiextruder_16x4" in
the [display] section of the printer.cfg file.

20200308: The default `__test` menu item was removed. If the config
file has a custom menu then be sure to remove all references to this
`__test` menu item.

20200308: The menu "deck" and "card" options were removed. To
customize the layout of an lcd screen use the new display_data config
sections (see config/example-extras.cfg for the details).

20200109:  The bed_mesh module now references the probe's location
in for the mesh configuration.  As such, some configuration options
have been renamed to more accurately reflect their intended
functionality.  For rectangular beds, `min_point` and `max_point`
have been renamed to `mesh_min` and `mesh_max` respectively.  For
round beds, `bed_radius` has been renamed to `mesh_radius`.  A new
`mesh_origin` option has also been added for round beds.  Note that
these changes are also incompatible with previously saved mesh profiles.
If an incompatible profile is detected it will be ignored and scheduled
for removal.  The removal process can be completed by issuing the
SAVE_CONFIG command. The user will need to re-calibrate each profile.

20191218: The display config section no longer supports "lcd_type:
st7567".  Use the "uc1701" display type instead - set "lcd_type:
uc1701" and change the "rs_pin: some_pin" to "rst_pin: some_pin".  It
may also be necessary to add a "contrast: 60" config setting.

20191210: The builtin T0, T1, T2, ... commands have been removed.  The
extruder activate_gcode and deactivate_gcode config options have been
removed.  If these commands (and scripts) are needed then define
individual [gcode_macro T0] style macros that call the
ACTIVATE_EXTRUDER command.  See the config/sample-idex.cfg and
sample-multi-extruder.cfg files for examples.

20191210: Support for the M206 command has been removed.  Replace with
calls to SET_GCODE_OFFSET.  If support for M206 is needed, add a
[gcode_macro M206] config section that calls SET_GCODE_OFFSET.  (For
example "SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=-{params.Z}".)

20191202: Support for the undocumented "S" parameter of the "G4"
command has been removed.  Replace any occurrences of S with the
standard "P" parameter (the delay specified in milliseconds).

20191126: The USB names have changed on micro-controllers with native
USB support.  They now use a unique chip id by default (where
available).  If an "mcu" config section uses a "serial" setting that
starts with "/dev/serial/by-id/" then it may be necessary to update
the config.  Run "ls /dev/serial/by-id/*" in an ssh terminal to
determine the new id.

20191121: The pressure_advance_lookahead_time parameter has been
removed.  See example.cfg for alternate configuration settings.

20191112: The tmc stepper driver virtual enable capability is now
automatically enabled if the stepper does not have a dedicated stepper
enable pin.  Remove references to tmcXXXX:virtual_enable from the
config.  The ability to control multiple pins in the stepper
enable_pin config has been removed.  If multiple pins are needed then
use a multi_pin config section.

20191107: The primary extruder config section must be specified as
"extruder" and may no longer be specified as "extruder0". Gcode
command templates that query the extruder status are now accessed via
"{printer.extruder}".

20191021: Klipper v0.8.0 released

20191003: The move_to_previous option in [safe_z_homing] now defaults
to False.  (It was effectively False prior to 20190918.)

20190918: The zhop option in [safe_z_homing] is always re-applied
after Z axis homing completed. This might need users to update custom
scripts based on this module.

20190806: The SET_NEOPIXEL command has been renamed to SET_LED.

20190726: The mcp4728 digital-to-analog code has changed. The default
i2c_address is now 0x60 and the voltage reference is now relative to
the mcp4728's internal 2.048 volt reference.

20190710: The z_hop option was removed from the [firmware_retract]
config section. The z_hop support was incomplete and could cause
incorrect behavior with several common slicers.

20190710: The optional parameters of the PROBE_ACCURACY command have
changed. It may be necessary to update any macros or scripts that use
that command.

20190628: All configuration options have been removed from the
[skew_correction] section.  Configuration for skew_correction
is now done via the SET_SKEW gcode.  See [Skew Correction](Skew_Correction.md)
for recommended usage.

20190607: The "variable_X" parameters of gcode_macro (along with the
VALUE parameter of SET_GCODE_VARIABLE) are now parsed as Python
literals. If a value needs to be assigned a string then wrap the value
in quotes so that it is evaluated as a string.

20190606: The "samples", "samples_result", and "sample_retract_dist"
config options have been moved to the "probe" config section. These
options are no longer supported in the "delta_calibrate", "bed_tilt",
"bed_mesh", "screws_tilt_adjust", "z_tilt", or "quad_gantry_level"
config sections.

20190528: The magic "status" variable in gcode_macro template
evaluation has been renamed to "printer".

20190520: The SET_GCODE_OFFSET command has changed; update any g-code
macros accordingly. The command will no longer apply the requested
offset to the next G1 command. The old behavior may be approximated by
using the new "MOVE=1" parameter.

20190404: The Python host software packages were updated. Users will
need to rerun the ~/klipper/scripts/install-octopi.sh script (or
otherwise upgrade the python dependencies if not using a standard
OctoPi installation).

20190404: The i2c_bus and spi_bus parameters (in various config
sections) now take a bus name instead of a number.

20190404: The sx1509 config parameters have changed. The 'address'
parameter is now 'i2c_address' and it must be specified as a decimal
number. Where 0x3E was previously used, specify 62.

20190328: The min_speed value in [temperature_fan] config
will now be respected and the fan will always run at this
speed or higher in PID mode.

20190322: The default value for "driver_HEND" in [tmc2660] config
sections was changed from 6 to 3. The "driver_VSENSE" field was
removed (it is now automatically calculated from run_current).

20190310: The [controller_fan] config section now always takes a name
(such as [controller_fan my_controller_fan]).
