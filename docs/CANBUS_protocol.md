# CANBUS protocol

This document describes the protocol Klipper uses to communicate over
[CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus). See
[CANBUS.md](CANBUS.md) for information on configuring Klipper with CAN
bus.

## Micro-controller id assignment

Klipper uses only CAN 2.0A standard size CAN bus packets, which are
limited to 8 data bytes and an 11-bit CAN bus identifier. In order to
support efficient communication, each micro-controller is assigned at
run-time a unique 1-byte CAN bus nodeid (`canbus_nodeid`) for general
Klipper command and response traffic. Klipper command messages going
from host to micro-controller use the CAN bus id of `canbus_nodeid *
2 + 256`, while Klipper response messages from micro-controller to
host use `canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256 + 1`.

Each micro-controller has a factory assigned unique chip identifier
that is used during id assignment. This identifier can exceed the
length of one CAN packet, so a hash function is used to generate a
unique 6-byte id (`canbus_uuid`) from the factory id.

## Admin messages

Admin messages are used for id assignment. Admin messages sent from
host to micro-controller use the CAN bus id `0x3f0` and messages sent
from micro-controller to host use the CAN bus id `0x3f1`. All
micro-controllers listen to messages on id `0x3f0`; that id can be
thought of as a "broadcast address".

### CMD_QUERY_UNASSIGNED message

This command queries all micro-controllers that have not yet been
assigned a `canbus_nodeid`. Unassigned micro-controllers will respond
with a RESP_NEED_NODEID response message.

The CMD_QUERY_UNASSIGNED message format is:
`<1-byte message_id = 0x00>`

### CMD_SET_NODEID message

This command assigns a `canbus_nodeid` to the micro-controller with a
given `canbus_uuid`.

The CMD_SET_NODEID message format is:
`<1-byte message_id = 0x01><6-byte canbus_uuid><1-byte canbus_nodeid>`

### RESP_NEED_NODEID message

The RESP_NEED_NODEID message format is:
`<1-byte message_id = 0x20><6-byte canbus_uuid>`

## Data Packets

A micro-controller that has been assigned a nodeid via the
CMD_SET_NODEID command can send and receive data packets.

The packet data in messages using the node's receive CAN bus id
(`canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256`) are simply appended to a buffer, and when
a complete [mcu protocol message](Protocol.md) is found its contents
are parsed and processed. The data is treated as a byte stream - there
is no requirement for the start of a Klipper message block to align
with the start of a CAN bus packet.

Similarly, mcu protocol message responses are sent from
micro-controller to host by copying the message data into one or more
packets with the node's transmit CAN bus id (`canbus_nodeid * 2 +
256 + 1`).
