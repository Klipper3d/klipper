# Community Forum

There is a [Klipper Community Discourse
server](https://community.klipper3d.org) for discussions on Klipper.

# Discord Chat

There is a Discord server dedicated to Klipper at:
[https://discord.klipper3d.org](https://discord.klipper3d.org).

This server is run by a community of Klipper enthusiasts dedicated to
discussions on Klipper. It allows users to chat with other users in
real-time.

# I have a question about Klipper

Many questions we receive are already answered in the [Klipper
documentation](Overview.md). Please be sure to to read the
documentation and follow the directions provided there.

It is also possible to search for similar questions in the [Klipper
Community Forum](#community-forum).

If you are interested in sharing your knowledge and experience with
other Klipper users then you can join the [Klipper Community
Forum](#community-forum) or [Klipper Discord
Chat](#discord-chat). Both are communities where Klipper users can
discuss Klipper with other users.

Many questions we receive are general 3d-printing questions that are
not specific to Klipper. If you have a general question or are
experiencing general printing problems, then you will likely get a
better response by asking in a general 3d-printing forum or a forum
dedicated to your printer hardware.

Do not open a Klipper github issue to ask a question.

# I have a feature request

All new features require someone interested and able to implement that
feature. If you are interested in helping to implement or test a new
feature, you can search for ongoing developments in the [Klipper
Community Forum](#community-forum). There is also [Klipper Discord
Chat](#discord-chat) for discussions between collaborators.

Do not open a Klipper github issue to request a feature.

# Help! It doesn't work!

Unfortunately, we receive many more requests for help than we could
possibly answer. Most problem reports we see are eventually tracked
down to:
1. Subtle errors in the hardware, or
2. Not following all the steps described in the Klipper documentation.

If you are experiencing problems we recommend you carefully read the
[Klipper documentation](Overview.md) and double check that all steps
were followed.

If you are experiencing a printing problem, then we recommend
carefully inspecting the printer hardware (all joints, wires, screws,
etc.) and verify nothing is abnormal. We find most printing problems
are not related to the Klipper software. If you do find a problem with
the printer hardware then you will likely get a better response by
searching in a general 3d-printing forum or in a forum dedicated to
your printer hardware.

It is also possible to search for similar issues in the [Klipper
Community Forum](#community-forum).

If you are interested in sharing your knowledge and experience with
other Klipper users then you can join the [Klipper Community

# I have diagnosed a defect in the Klipper software

Klipper is an open-source project and we appreciate when collaborators
diagnose errors in the software.

There is important information that will be needed in order to fix a
bug. Please follow these steps:
1. Be sure the bug is in the Klipper software. If you are thinking
   "there is a problem, I can't figure out why, and therefore it is a
   Klipper bug", then **do not** open a github issue. In that case,
   someone interested and able will need to first research and
   diagnose the root cause of the problem. If you would like to share
   the results of your research or check if other users are
   experiencing similar issues then you can search the [Klipper
   Community Forum](#community-forum).
2. Make sure you are running unmodified code from
   [https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper).
   If the code has been modified or is obtained from another source,
   then you will need to reproduce the problem on the unmodified code
   from
   [https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper)
   prior to reporting an issue.
3. If possible, run an `M112` command in the OctoPrint terminal window
   immediately after the undesirable event occurs. This causes Klipper
   to go into a "shutdown state" and it will cause additional
   debugging information to be written to the log file.
4. Obtain the Klipper log file from the event. The log file has been
   engineered to answer common questions the Klipper developers have
   about the software and its environment (software version, hardware
   type, configuration, event timing, and hundreds of other
   questions).
   1. The Klipper log file is located in `/tmp/klippy.log` on the
      Klipper "host" computer (the Raspberry Pi).
   2. An "scp" or "sftp" utility is needed to copy this log file to
      your desktop computer. The "scp" utility comes standard with
      Linux and MacOS desktops. There are freely available scp
      utilities for other desktops (eg, WinSCP). If using a graphical
      scp utility that can not directly copy `/tmp/klippy.log` then
      repeatedly click on `..` or `parent folder` until you get to the
      root directory, click on the `tmp` folder, and then select the
      `klippy.log` file.
   3. Copy the log file to your desktop so that it can be attached to
      an issue report.
   4. Do not modify the log file in any way; do not provide a snippet
      of the log. Only the full unmodified log file provides the
      necessary information.
   5. If the log file is very large (eg, greater than 2MB) then one
      may need to compress the log with zip or gzip.
5. Open a new github issue at
   [https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/issues](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/issues)
   and provide a clear description of the problem. The Klipper
   developers need to understand what steps were taken, what the
   desired outcome was, and what outcome actually occurred. The
   Klipper log file **must be attached** to that ticket:

# I am making changes that I'd like to include in Klipper

Klipper is open-source software and we appreciate new contributions.

New contributions (for both code and documentation) are submitted via
Github Pull Requests. See the [CONTRIBUTING document](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for important information.

There are several [documents for
developers](Overview.md#developer-documentation). If you have
questions on the code then you can also ask in the [Klipper Community
Forum](#community-forum) or on the [Klipper Community
Discord](#discord-chat). If you would like to provide an update on
your current progress then you can open a Github issue with the
location of your code, an overview of the changes, and a description
of its current status.
