# This file contains pin mappings for the Creality CR-10 Smart
# with a CR-FDM-v2.5.S1 -100 mainboard (STM32F103RET6).
#
# NOTE: This configuration was created because the existing CR-10 Smart
# examples in config/printer-creality-cr10-smart-*.cfg did not work with
# this specific CR-FDM-v2.5.S1 mainboard variant. This config is based on
# reverse-engineered pin analysis and confirmed working configuration.
#
# Hardware architecture:
# - Main board: STM32F103RET6 microcontroller
# - Secondary strain gauge board: STM32F030F4P6 + NX711 load cell ADC
#   Connectors: 2x7 pin (14-pin) and 2x8 pin (16-pin) headers to main board
#   Communicates with main board via I2C/UART for strain gauge data
# - This configuration uses physical Z endstop instead of strain gauge probe
#   to ensure reliable operation

# To use this config, during "make menuconfig" select the STM32F103
# with a "64KiB bootloader" and serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) communication.

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning the printer on with the card inserted. The firmware filename
# must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename that was flashed.


# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

# Probe pins (UNCONFIRMED): PA4 (probe signal?), PA5 (tare control?)
# WARNING: Pin assignments are speculative based on available pins only
# Strain gauge probe communication protocol completely unknown
# PA4/PA5 chosen because they are freed when probe is disabled, but actual
# probe pins may be different or require secondary board firmware modifications
# Communication with main board via dedicated pins (not USART1)

# Notes for developers:
# - PA9/PA10: Reserved for USART1 (host communication)

# Pin assignments below are speculative and likely incorrect
# No successful probe operation achieved - use physical Z endstop for reliability
