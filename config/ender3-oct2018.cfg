# This file contains common pin mappings for the 2018 Creality
# Ender 3. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# AVR atmega1284p.

# Note, a number of Melzi boards are shipped with a bootloader that
# requires the following command to flash the board:
#  avrdude -p atmega1284p -c arduino -b 57600 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U out/klipper.elf.hex
# If the above command does not work and "make flash" does not work
# then one may need to flash a bootloader to the board - see the
# Klipper docs/Bootloaders.md file for more information.

# A note on pin names: pins may be configured with a hardware name
# (such as "PA4") or with an Arduino alias name (such as "ar29" or
# "analog3"). In order to use Arduino names, the pin_map variable in
# the mcu section must be present and have a value of "arduino".
# Pin names may be preceded by an '!' to indicate that a reverse
# polarity should be used (eg, trigger on low instead of high). Input
# pins may be preceded by a '^' to indicate that a hardware pull-up
# resistor should be enabled for the pin.

#   boards and clones. The 'rpi_usb' method is useful on Raspberry Pi
#   boards with micro-controllers powered over USB - it briefly
#   disables power to all USB ports to accomplish a micro-controller
#   reset. The 'command' method involves sending a Klipper command to

#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
max_z_velocity: 5
#   For cartesian printers this sets the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of

max_z_accel: 100
#   For cartesian printers this sets the maximum acceleration (in

#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.

#activate_gcode:
#    SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=10
#    SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=60
#    G4 P200
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute prior to each probe attempt. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#    SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=90
#    G4 P100
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute after each probe attempt completes. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.

# BLTouch probe. One may define this section (instead of a probe
# section) to enable a BLTouch probe. A virtual
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin is also created (see the "probe"
# section above for the details).
#[bltouch]
#sensor_pin:
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch sensor pin. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#control_pin:
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch control pin. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pin_move_time:
#   The amount of time (in seconds) that it takes the BLTouch pin to
#   move up or down. The default is 0.200 seconds.
#x_offset:
#y_offset:

#speed:
#   See the "probe" section for information on these parameters.

# Bed tilt compensation. One may define a [bed_tilt] config section to
# enable move transformations that account for a tilted bed.
#[bed_tilt]
#x_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the X
#   axis. The default is 0.
#y_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the Y
#   axis. The default is 0.
#z_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to the Z height when the nozzle is nominally at
#   0,0. The default is 0.
# The remaining parameters control a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE extended

# adjustment parameters.
#points:
#    100,100
#    10,10

#    100,190
#    190,10
#    190,100
#    190,190
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE
#   command. Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe
#   is above the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. The default is
#   to not enable the command.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.
#[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.
#min_point:
#   An X,Y point defining the minimum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Note that this refers to the nozzle position,
#   and take care that you do not define a point that will move
#   the probe off of the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#max_point:
#   An X,Y point defining the maximum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point.
#   Also note that this does not necessarily define the last point
#   probed, only the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   A comma separated pair of integer values (X,Y) defining the number
#   of points to probe along each axis. A single value is also valid,
#   in which case that value will be for both axes. Default is 3,3
#   which probes a 3x3 grid.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.

# If the BLTouch is used to home the Z axis, then define a
# homing_override section, use probe:z_virtual_endstop as the
# endstop_pin in the stepper_z section, and do not set
# position_endstop in the stepper_z section.
# Homing override. One may use this mechanism to run a series of
# g-code commands in place of a G28 found in the normal g-code input.
# This may be useful on printers that require a specific procedure to
# home the machine.
#[homing_override]
#gcode:
#    ; G90   ; Uncomment these 2 lines to blindly lift the Z 2mm at start
#    ; G1 Z7 F600
#    G28 X0 Y0
#    G1 X100 Y100 F3600
#    G28 Z0
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute in place of G28 commands found in the normal
#   g-code input. If a G28 is contained in this list of commands then
#   it will invoke the normal homing procedure for the printer. The
#   commands listed here must home all axes. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#axes: z
#   The axes to override. For example, if this is set to "z" then the
#   override script will only be run when the z axis is homed (eg, via
#   a "G28" or "G28 Z0" command). Note, the override script should
#   still home all axes. The default is "xyz" which causes the
#   override script to be run in place of all G28 commands.
#set_position_x:
#set_position_y:
#set_position_z: 5
#   If specified, the printer will assume the axis is at the specified
#   position prior to running the above g-code commands. Setting this
#   disables homing checks for that axis. This may be useful if the
#   head must move prior to invoking the normal G28 mechanism for an
#   axis. The default is to not force a position for an axis.



# G-Code macros (one may define any number of sections with a
# "gcode_macro" prefix).
#[gcode_macro my_cmd]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute in place of "my_cmd". This parameter is
#   evaluated using Python "string format syntax" with the command
#   parameters as named arguments. For example, if one were to define
#   a macro MY_DELAY with gcode "G4 P{DELAY}" then the command
#   "MY_DELAY DELAY=100" would evaluate to "G4 P100". This parameter
#   must be provided.
#default_parameter_<parameter>:
#   One may define any number of options with a "default_parameter_"
#   prefix. Use this to define default values for g-code parameters.
#   For example, if one were to define the macro MY_DELAY with gcode
#   "G4 P{DELAY}" along with "default_parameter_DELAY = 50" then the
#   command "MY_DELAY" would evaluate to "G4 P50". The default is to
#   require that all parameters used in the gcode script be present in
#   the command invoking the macro.


# M300 : Play tone, Beeper support, as commonly found on usual LCD displays
# i.e. RepRapDiscount 2004 Smart Controller, RepRapDiscount 12864 Full Graphic
# This defines a custom I/O pin and a custom GCODE macro
# Usage: M300 [P<ms>] [S<Hz>]      P is the tone duration, S the tone frequency.
# as it is based on a PWM duty cycle, the frequency won't be pitch perfect.
#
#[output_pin BEEPER_pin]
#pin: ar37
#   Beeper pin. This parameter must be provided.
#   ar37 is the default RAMPS/MKS pin.
#pwm: True
#   A piezo beeper needs a PWM signal, a DC buzzer doesn't.
#value: 0
#   Silent at power on, set to 1 if active low.
#shutdown_value: 0
#   Disable at emergency shutdown (no PWM would be available anyway).
#cycle_time: 0.001
#   PWM frequency : 0.001 = 1ms will give a base tone of 1kHz
#scale: 1000
#   PWM parameter will be in the range of (0-1000 Hz).
#   Although not pitch perfect.
#
#[gcode_macro M300]
#default_parameter_S=1000
#   Allows for a default 1kHz tone if S is omitted
#default_parameter_P=100
#   Allows for a default 10ms duration is P is omitted
#gcode:  SET_PIN PIN=BEEPER_pin VALUE={S}
#        G4 P{P}
#        SET_PIN PIN=BEEPER_pin VALUE=0
