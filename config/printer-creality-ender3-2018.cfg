# This file contains common pin mappings for the 2018 Creality
# Ender 3. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# AVR atmega1284p.

# Note, a number of Melzi boards are shipped with a bootloader that
# requires the following command to flash the board:
#  avrdude -p atmega1284p -c arduino -b 57600 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U out/klipper.elf.hex
# If the above command does not work and "make flash" does not work
# then one may need to flash a bootloader to the board - see the
# Klipper docs/Bootloaders.md file for more information.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

# The print bed can move so far to the front, that the nozzle can reach the
# plastic cover of the print bed heater cable (only when the bed is moved by
# hand). By homing the Y axis before the X axis, it is ensured the nozzle will
# not melt through the plastic part.
# BEWARE: You will lose the ability to home axes individually. The printer will
# always home all axes for every G28 command.
