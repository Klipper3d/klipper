# This file contains common pin mappings for the 2019 Monoprice
# Select Mini v2. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32F070 microcontroller with an 8MHz crystal and USB for communication.
#
# Use the following settings in make menuconfig:
#
#  * Microcontroller architecture: STM32
#  * Processor: STM32F070
#  * Clockspeed: 8 Mhz
#  * USB communication (instead of serial)
#
#  IMPORTANT: A bootloader offset of 8KiB will preserver the stock bootloader
#  and allows easy flashing via SDCard without additional hardware.
#
#  Also make sure to use the following string in the low-level configuration
#  options to set a couple of GPIOs to high when the MCU boots:
#
#  PA8, PB11, PB1
#
#  This will deactivate the steppers until klippy takes over.
#
# Note 1: You can flash klipper by copying out/klipper.bin to the MPSMv2's
# SDCard, inserting the SDCard while the printer is off and switching it on.
# Returning to stock firmware without a programmer is possible, as long as you
# do not overwrite the bootloader.
#
# Note 2: Stepper directions are not consistent in MSPMv2 printers. Check the
# directions of your device with M503 in the stock firmware and adjust the
# dir_pins below accordingly.
#
# Note 3: Klipper currently does not support the LCD-UI of this
# printer, which is connected via serial interface and controlled by an
# esp8266 using a custom protocol. But it is possible to use the original
# rotary encoder & button with an extra display. An example of how to attach
# a SSD1306 OLED display is commented out at the bottom.
#
# Note 4: Monoprice has made small changes in the series of Select Mini
# printers without updating the printers version. Please consider adding your
# boards reversion to the list of compatible motion controllers below or
# submitting a new config template if significant changes are required.
#
# Tested montion controller reversions:
# * MPSM motion M2-v3.0-170721
#
# See ../docs/Config_Reference.md file for a description of all parameters.

# Later motion controllers have a unused socket that can be used to
# attach a probe or other additional hardware.
# You will need a JST PH 4-pin connector. Pin order (from STM32 to
# SDCard-slot) is: GND-PA2-PA3-3.3V
#
# Older BLtouch sensors and knock offs require 5V supply voltage.
# Since the motion controller does not supply 5V you will need to add
# an appropriate power source. easiest is probably soldering a 5V step
# down converter to the 12V supply pins. When running the touch sensor
# on 5V you will also need reduce the voltage on the sensor_pin with a
# voltage divider or level shifter. The control_pin can be attached to
# a 5V touch sensor directly.
