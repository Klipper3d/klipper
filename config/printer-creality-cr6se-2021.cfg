# This file contains pin mappings for the Creality CR6-SE with Rev. 4.5.3 Motherboard (Late 2020/2021) as the heater pins changed.
# To use this config, during "make menuconfig" select the STM32F103
# with a "28KiB bootloader" and serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9)
# communication.

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
