######################################################################

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.
#
#  Visual Examples:
#   rectangular bed, probe_count = 3,3:
#               x---x---x (max_point)
#               |
#               x---x---x
#                       |
#   (min_point) x---x---x
#
#   round bed, round_probe_count = 5, bed_radius = r:
#                  x (0,r) end
#                /
#              x---x---x
#                        \
#   (-r,0) x---x---x---x---x (r,0)
#            \
#              x---x---x
#                    /
#                  x  (0,-r) start
#
#[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#bed_radius:
#   Defines the radius to probe for round beds.  Note that the radius
#   is relative to the nozzle's origin, if using a probe be sure to
#   account for its offset.  This parameter must be provided for round
#   beds and omitted for rectangular beds.
#min_point:
#   Defines the minimum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Note that this refers to the nozzle position, take care that
#   you do not define a point that will move the probe off of the bed.
#   This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
#max_point:
#   Defines the maximum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point. Also note
#   that this does not necessarily define the last point probed, only
#   the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each axis.
#   A single value is also valid, in which case that value will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 3,3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this is integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.

# Bed tilt compensation. One may define a [bed_tilt] config section to
# enable move transformations that account for a tilted bed.
#[bed_tilt]
#x_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the X
#   axis. The default is 0.
#y_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the Y
#   axis. The default is 0.
#z_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to the Z height when the nozzle is nominally at
#   0,0. The default is 0.
# The remaining parameters control a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that may be used to calibrate appropriate x and y
# adjustment parameters.
#points:
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE

#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.

# Tool to help adjust bed leveling screws. One may define a
# [bed_screws] config section to enable a BED_SCREWS_ADJUST g-code
# command.
#[bed_screws]
#screw1: 100,100
#   The X,Y coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to that is directly above the bed
#   screw (or as close as possible while still being above the bed).
#   This parameter must be provided.
#screw1_name: front screw
#   An arbitrary name for the given screw. This name is displayed when
#   the helper script runs. The default is to use a name based upon
#   the screw XY location.
#screw1_fine_adjust:
#   An X,Y coordinate to command the nozzle to so that one can fine
#   tune the bed leveling screw. The default is to not perform fine

#   The type of screw used for bed level, M3, M4 or M5 and the
#   direction of the knob used to level the bed, clockwise decrease
#   counter-clockwise decrease.
#   Accepted values: CW-M3, CCW-M3, CW-M4, CCW-M4, CW-M5, CCW-M5.
#   Default value is CW-M3, most printers use an M3 screw and
#   turning the knob clockwise decrease distance.

# Multiple Z stepper tilt adjustment. This feature enables independent
# adjustment of multiple z steppers (see stepper_z1 section below) to
# adjust for tilt. If this section is present then a Z_TILT_ADJUST
# extended G-Code command becomes available.
#[z_tilt]
#z_positions:
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the XY position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.

#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.

# Moving gantry leveling using 4 independently controlled Z motors.
# Corrects hyperbolic parabola effects (potato chip) on moving gantry
# which is more flexible.
# WARNING: Using this on a moving bed may lead to undesirable results.
# If this section is present then a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL extended G-Code
# command becomes available. This routine assumes the following Z motor
# configuration:
# ----------------
# |Z1          Z2|
# |  ---------   |
# |  |       |   |
# |  |       |   |
# |  x--------   |
# |Z           Z3|
# ----------------
# Where x is the (0,0) point on the bed
#[quad_gantry_level]
#gantry_corners:
#   A newline separated list of X,Y coordinates describing the
#   two opposing corners of the gantry. The first entry corresponds to
#   Z, the second to Z2.
#   This parameter must be provided.
#points:
#   A newline separated list of four X,Y points that should be probed

#   This parameter must be provided.
#   For maximum accuracy, ensure your probe offsets are configured.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5
#max_adjust: 4
#   Safety limit if an ajustment greater than this value is requested
#   quad_gantry_level will abort.
#retries: 0
#   number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within tolerance
#retry_tolerance: 0
#   if retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed points
#   differ more than retry_tolerance

# Printer Skew Correction.  It is possible to use software to correct
# printer skew across 3 planes, xy, xz, yz.  This is done by printing
# a calibration model along a plane and measuring three lengths.  Due
# to the nature of skew correction these lengths are set via gcode. See
# skew_correction.md and G-Codes.md in the docs directory for details.

######################################################################
# Customized homing
######################################################################

# Safe Z homing. One may use this mechanism to home the Z axis at a
# specific XY coordinate. This is useful if the toolhead, for example
# has to move to the center of the bed before Z can be homed.
#[safe_z_home]
#home_xy_position:
#   A X,Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the Z homing should be
#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50.0
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home coordinate.
#   The default is 50 mm/s
#z_hop: 0.0
#   Lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is applied to any homing command,
#   even if it doesn't home the Z axis. If the Z axis is already homed and
#   the zhop would exceed the printer limits, the zhop is ignored. If a lift
#   has already been performed or the Z axis is known to be equally or higher
#   than this distance, the zhop is ignored. After homing Z completed, the
#   printhead is lifted to zhop, respecting the probe's z_offset.
#   The default is 0.0mm.
#z_hop_speed: 20.0
#   Speed at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The default is 20mm/s.
#move_to_previous: False
#   When set to True, xy are reset to their previous positions after z homing.
#   The default is False.


# Homing override. One may use this mechanism to run a series of
# g-code commands in place of a G28 found in the normal g-code input.
# This may be useful on printers that require a specific procedure to
# home the machine.
#[homing_override]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of G28 commands
#   found in the normal g-code input. See docs/Command_Templates.md
#   for G-Code format. If a G28 is contained in this list of commands
#   then it will invoke the normal homing procedure for the printer.
#   The commands listed here must home all axes. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#axes: xyz
#   The axes to override. For example, if this is set to "z" then the
#   override script will only be run when the z axis is homed (eg, via
#   a "G28" or "G28 Z0" command). Note, the override script should
#   still home all axes. The default is "xyz" which causes the
#   override script to be run in place of all G28 commands.
#set_position_x:
#set_position_y:
#set_position_z:
#   If specified, the printer will assume the axis is at the specified
#   position prior to running the above g-code commands. Setting this
#   disables homing checks for that axis. This may be useful if the
#   head must move prior to invoking the normal G28 mechanism for an
#   axis. The default is to not force a position for an axis.

# Stepper phase adjusted endstops. To use this feature, define a
# config section with an "endstop_phase" prefix followed by the name
# of the corresponding stepper config section (for example,
# "[endstop_phase stepper_z]"). This feature can improve the accuracy
# of endstop switches. Add a bare "[endstop_phase]" declaration to
# enable the ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE command.
#[endstop_phase stepper_z]
#phases:
#   This specifies the number of phases of the given stepper motor
#   driver (which is the number of micro-steps multiplied by four).
#   This setting is automatically determined if one uses a TMC driver
#   with run-time configuration. Otherwise, this parameter must be
#   provided.
#endstop_accuracy: 0.200
#   Sets the expected accuracy (in mm) of the endstop. This represents
#   the maximum error distance the endstop may trigger (eg, if an
#   endstop may occasionally trigger 100um early or up to 100um late
#   then set this to 0.200 for 200um). The default is
#   phases*step_distance.
#endstop_phase:
#   This specifies the phase of the stepper motor driver to expect
#   when hitting the endstop. Only set this value if one is sure the
#   stepper motor driver is reset every time the mcu is reset. If this
#   is not set, then the stepper phase will be detected on the first
#   home and that phase will be used on all subsequent homes.
#endstop_align_zero: False
#   If true then the position_endstop of the axis will effectively be
#   modified so that the zero position for the axis occurs at a full
#   step on the stepper motor. (If used on the Z axis and the print
#   layer height is a multiple of a full step distance then every
#   layer will occur on a full step.) The default is False.


######################################################################
# G-Code macros and events
######################################################################

# G-Code macros (one may define any number of sections with a
# "gcode_macro" prefix).
#[gcode_macro my_cmd]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of "my_cmd". See
#   docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#default_parameter_<parameter>:
#   One may define any number of options with a "default_parameter_"
#   prefix. Use this to define default values for g-code parameters.
#   For example, if one were to define the macro MY_DELAY with gcode
#   "G4 P{DELAY}" along with "default_parameter_DELAY = 50" then the
#   command "MY_DELAY" would evaluate to "G4 P50". The default is to
#   require that all parameters used in the gcode script be present in
#   the command invoking the macro.
#variable_<name>:
#   One may specify any number of options with a "variable_" prefix.
#   The given variable name will be assigned the given value (parsed
#   as a Python literal) and will be available during macro expansion.
#   For example, a config with "variable_fan_speed = 75" might have
#   gcode commands containing "M106 S{ fan_speed * 255 }". Variables
#   can be changed at run-time using the SET_GCODE_VARIABLE command.

# Execute a gcode on a set delay.
#[delayed_gcode my_delayed_gcode]
#initial_duration: 0.
#   The duration of the initial delay (in seconds).  If set to a non-zero
#   value the delayed_gcode will execute the specified number of seconds
#   after the printer enters the "ready" state.  This can be useful for
#   initialization procedures or a repeating delayed_gcode.  If set to 0
#   the delayed_gcode will not execute on startup.  Default is 0.
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute when the delay duration has
#   elapsed.  G-Code templates are supported.  This parameter must be
#   provided.

# Idle timeout. An idle timeout is automatically enabled - add an
# explicit idle_timeout config section to change the default settings.
#[idle_timeout]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute on an idle timeout. See
#   docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. The default is to run
#   "TURN_OFF_HEATERS" and "M84".
#timeout: 600
#   Idle time (in seconds) to wait before running the above G-Code
#   commands. The default is 600 seconds.


######################################################################
# Optional G-Code features
######################################################################

# A virtual sdcard may be useful if the host machine is not fast
# enough to run OctoPrint well. It allows the Klipper host software to
# directly print gcode files stored in a directory on the host using
# standard sdcard G-Code commands (eg, M24).
#[virtual_sdcard]
#path: ~/.octoprint/uploads/
#   The path of the local directory on the host machine to look for
#   g-code files. This is a read-only directory (sdcard file writes
#   are not supported). One may point this to OctoPrint's upload
#   directory (generally ~/.octoprint/uploads/ ). This parameter must
#   be provided.

# Support manually moving stepper motors for diagnostic purposes.
# Note, using this feature may place the printer in an invalid state -
# see docs/G-Codes.md for important details.
#[force_move]
#enable_force_move: False
#   Set to true to enable FORCE_MOVE and SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION
#   extended G-Code commands. The default is false.

# Pause/Resume functionality with support of position capture and restore
#[pause_resume]
#recover_velocity: 50.
#   When capture/restore is enabled, the speed at which to return to
#   the captured position (in mm/s).  Default is 50.0 mm/s.

# Firmware filament retraction. This enables G10 (retract) and G11
# (unretract) GCODE commands issued by many slicers. The parameters
# below provide startup defaults, although the values can be adjusted
# via the SET_RETRACTION command, allowing per-filament settings and
# runtime tuning.
#[firmware_retraction]
#retract_length: 0
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated, and to
#   unretract when G11 is activated (but see unretract_extra_length below).

#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
#unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when unretracting.
#unretract_speed: 10
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.

# enables arc (G2/G3) commands. Only IJ version is supported
# example: "G2 X125 Y32 Z10 E5 I10.5 J10.5"
#[gcode_arcs]
#resolution: 1.0
#   An arc will be split into segments. Each segment's length will equal
#   the resolution in mm set above. Lower values will produce a finer arc,
#   but also more work for your machine. Arcs smaller than the configured
#   value will become straight lines.

# Enable the "M118" and "RESPOND" extended commands.
# [respond]
# default_type: echo
#    Sets the default prefix of the "M118" and "RESPOND" output to one of
#    the following:
#        echo: "echo: " (This is the default)
#        command: "// "
#        error: "!! "
# default_prefix: echo:
#    Directly sets the default prefix. If present, this value will override
#    the "default_type".

# Config file helpers
######################################################################

# Board pin aliases. One may define aliases for the pins on a

# board_pins config section name then it defaults to "mcu".)
#[board_pins mcu]
#aliases:
#   A comma separated list of "name=value" aliases to create for the
#   given micro-controller. For example, "EXP1_1=PE6" would create an
#   "EXP1_1" alias for the "PE6" pin. However, if "value" is enclosed

# Bed probing hardware
######################################################################

# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One
# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in
# the stepper_z config section.
#[probe]
#pin: ar15
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.

######################################################################

# Additional micro-controllers (one may define any number of sections

# additional pins that may be configured as heaters, steppers, fans,
# etc.. For example, if an "[mcu extra_mcu]" section is introduced,

#   axis is triggered.

# In a multi-extruder printer add an additional extruder section for

# Heater and temperature sensor verification. Heater verification is
# automatically enabled for each heater that is configured on the
# printer. Use verify_heater sections to change the default settings.
#[verify_heater heater_config_name]
#max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
#check_gain_time:
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating. Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
#hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
#heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this

#beta:
#   Alternatively, one may define temperature1, resistance1, and beta

# between a set of configured temperature/voltage (or
# temperature/resistance) measurements to determine the temperature.
# The resulting sensor can be used as a sensor_type in a heater

# containing two pins and then set "pin=multi_pin:my_fan" in the
# "[fan]" section - on each fan change both output pins would be
# updated. These aliases may not be used with stepper motor pins.

######################################################################

# Filament Switch Sensor.  Support for filament insert and runout detection
# using a switch sensor, such as an endstop switch.
#[filament_switch_sensor my_sensor]
#pause_on_runout: True
#   When set to True, a PAUSE will execute immediately after a runout
#   is detected. Note that if pause_on_runout is False and the
#   runout_gcode is omitted then runout detection is disabled. Default
#   is True.
#runout_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament runout is
#   detected. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. If
#   pause_on_runout is set to True this G-Code will run after the
#   PAUSE is complete. The default is not to run any G-Code commands.
#insert_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament insert is
#   detected. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. The
#   default is not to run any G-Code commands, which disables insert
#   detection.
#event_delay: 3.0
#   The minimum amount of time in seconds to delay between events.
#   Events triggered during this time period will be silently
#   ignored. The default is 3 seconds.
#pause_delay: 0.5
#   The amount of time to delay, in seconds, between the pause command
#   dispatch and execution of the runout_gcode.  It may be useful to
#   increase this delay if Octoprint exhibits strange pause behavior.
#   Default is 0.5 seconds.
#switch_pin:
#   The pin on which the switch is connected. This parameter must be
#   provided.

# Configure an SX1509 I2C to GPIO expander. Due to the delay incurred
# by I2C communication you should NOT use SX1509 pins as stepper enable,
# step or dir pins or any other pin that requires fast bit-banging. They
# are best used as static or gcode controlled digital outputs or hardware-pwm
# pins for e.g. fans. One may define any number of sections with an "sx1509"
# prefix. Each expander provides a set of 16 pins (sx1509_my_sx1509:PIN_0 to
# sx1509_my_sx1509:PIN_15) which can be used in the printer configuration.
#[sx1509 my_sx1509]
#i2c_mcu: mcu
#   The name of the micro-controller that the SX1509 chip is connected
#   to. The default is "mcu".
#i2c_address:
#   I2C address used by this expander. Depending on the hardware jumpers
#   this is one out of the following addresses: 62 63 112 113. This
#   parameter must be provided.
#i2c_bus:
#   If the I2C implementation of your microcontroller supports
#   multiple I2C busses, you may specify the bus name here. The
#   default is to use the default micro-controller i2c bus.

# SAMD SERCOM configuration to specify which pins to use on a given SERCOM.
# One may define one section with the "samd_sercom" prefix per
# SERCOM available. Each SERCOM must be configured prior to using it as
# SPI or I2C peripheral. Place this config section above any other section
# that makes use of SPI or I2C buses.
#[samd_sercom sercom0]
#tx_pin:
#   MOSI pin for SPI communication, or SDA (data) pin for I2C
#   communication. The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration
#   for the given SERCOM peripheral. This parameter must be provided.
#rx_pin:
#   MISO pin for SPI communication. This pin is not used for I2C
#   communication (I2C uses tx_pin for both sending and receiving).
#   The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration for the given
#   SERCOM peripheral. This parameter is optional.
#clk_pin:
#   CLK pin for SPI communication, or SCL (clock) pin for I2C
#   communication. The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration
#   for the given SERCOM peripheral. This parameter must be provided.

# Replicape support - see the generic-replicape.cfg file for further
# details.
