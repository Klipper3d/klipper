# This file serves as documentation for config parameters of
# additional devices that may be configured on a printer. The snippets
# in this file may be copied into the main printer.cfg file. See the
# "example.cfg" file for description of common config parameters.
#
# Note, where an extra config section creates additional pins, the
# section defining the pins must be listed in the config file before
# any sections using those pins.


# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One
# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in
# the stepper_z config section.

#pin: ar15
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.

#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute after each probe attempt completes. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to

#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.


# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.

#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.
#min_point:
#   An X,Y point defining the minimum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Note that this refers to the nozzle position,
#   and take care that you do not define a point that will move
#   the probe off of the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#max_point:
#   An X,Y point defining the maximum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point.
#   Also note that this does not necessarily define the last point
#   probed, only the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   A comma separated pair of integer values (X,Y) defining the number
#   of points to probe along each axis. A single value is also valid,

#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.


# Multiple Z stepper tilt adjustment. This feature enables independent
# adjustment of multiple z steppers (see stepper_z1 section below) to
# adjust for tilt. If this section is present then a Z_TILT_ADJUST
# extended G-Code command becomes available.
#[z_tilt]
#z_positions:

#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.


# Moving gantry leveling using 4 independently controlled Z motors.
# Corrects hyperbolic parabola effects (potato chip) on moving gantry
# which is more flexible.
# WARNING: Using this on a moving bed may lead to undesirable results.
# If this section is present then a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL extended G-Code
# command becomes available. This routine assumes the following Z motor
# configuration:
# ----------------
# |Z1          Z2|
# |  ---------   |
# |  |       |   |

#   Distance in mm to retract the probe between samples. Default is 2.


# In a multi-extruder printer add an additional extruder section for
# each additional extruder. The additional extruder sections should be
# named "extruder1", "extruder2", "extruder3", and so on. See the
# "extruder" section in example.cfg for a description of available
# parameters.
#[extruder1]
#step_pin: ar36
#dir_pin: ar34
#...
#shared_heater:
#   If this extruder uses the same heater already defined for another
#   extruder then place the name of that extruder here.  For example,
#   should extruder3 and extruder4 share a heater then the extruder3
#   config section should define the heater and the extruder4 section
#   should specify "shared_heater: extruder3". The default is to not
#   reuse an existing heater.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute on a G-Code tool change command (eg, "T1")
#   that deactivates this extruder and activates some other

#   G-Code commands on deactivation.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute on a G-Code tool change command (eg, "T0")
#   that activates this extruder. It only makes sense to define this
#   section on multi-extruder printers. The default is to not run any
#   special G-Code commands on activation.


# Support for cartesian printers with dual carriages on a single
# axis. The active carriage is set via the SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE extended
# g-code command. The "SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE CARRIAGE=1" command will
# activate the carriage defined in this section (CARRIAGE=0 will
# return activation to the primary carriage). Dual carriage support is
# typically combined with extra extruders - use the SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE
# command in the activate_gcode / deactivate_gcode section of the
# appropriate extruder. Be sure to also use that mechanism to park the
# carriages during deactivation.
#[dual_carriage]
#axis:
#   The axis this extra carriage is on (either x or y). This parameter
#   must be provided.
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:

# Heater and temperature sensor verification. Heater verification is
# automatically enabled for each heater that is configured on the
# printer. Use verify_heater sections to change the default settings.
#[verify_heater heater_config_name]
#heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by when approaching a new target temperature. The default is 2.
#check_gain_time:
#   The amount of time (in seconds) that the heating_gain must be met
#   in before an error is raised. The default is 20 seconds for
#   extruders and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
#hysteresis: 5
#   The difference between the target temperature and the current
#   temperature for the heater to be considered within range of the
#   target temperature. The default is 5.
#max_error: 120
#   The maximum temperature difference a heater that falls outside the
#   target temperature range may accumulate before an error is
#   raised. For example, if the target temperature is 200, the
#   hysteresis is 5, the max_error is 120, and the temperature is
#   reported at 185 degrees for 12 seconds then an error would be
#   raised (or 24 seconds at 190, or 120 seconds at 194, etc.). The
#   default is 120.


# Idle timeout. An idle timeout is automatically enabled - add an
# explicit idle_timeout config section to change the default settings.
#[idle_timeout]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute on an idle timeout. The default is to run
#   "TURN_OFF_HEATERS" and "M84".
#timeout: 600
#   Idle time (in seconds) to wait before running the above G-Code
#   commands. The default is 600 seconds.


# Multi-stepper axes. On a cartesian style printer, the stepper
# controlling a given axis may have additional config blocks defining
# steppers that should be stepped in concert with the primary
# stepper. One may define any number of sections with a numeric suffix
# starting at 1 (for example, "stepper_z1", "stepper_z2", etc.).
#[stepper_z1]
#step_pin: ar36
#dir_pin: ar34
#enable_pin: !ar30
#step_distance: .005
#   See the example.cfg for the definition of the above parameters.
#endstop_pin: ^ar19
#   If an endstop_pin is defined for the additional stepper then the
#   stepper will home until the endstop is triggered. Otherwise, the
#   stepper will home until the endstop on the primary stepper for the
#   axis is triggered.


# Stepper phase adjusted endstops. To use this feature, define a
# config section with an "endstop_phase" prefix followed by the name
# of the corresponding stepper config section (for example,
# "[endstop_phase stepper_z]"). This feature can improve the accuracy
# of endstop switches. Add a bare "[endstop_phase]" declaration to
# enable the ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE command.
#[endstop_phase stepper_z]
#phases:
#   This specifies the number of phases of the given stepper motor
#   driver (which is the number of micro-steps multiplied by four).
#   This setting is automatically determined if one uses TMC2130,
#   TMC2208, or TMC2224 drivers with run-time configuration.
#   Otherwise, this parameter must be provided.
#endstop_accuracy: 0.200
#   Sets the expected accuracy (in mm) of the endstop. This represents
#   the maximum error distance the endstop may trigger (eg, if an
#   endstop may occasionally trigger 100um early or up to 100um late
#   then set this to 0.200 for 200um). The default is
#   phases*step_distance.
#endstop_phase:
#   This specifies the phase of the stepper motor driver to expect
#   when hitting the endstop. Only set this value if one is sure the
#   stepper motor driver is reset every time the mcu is reset. If this
#   is not set, then the stepper phase will be detected on the first
#   home and that phase will be used on all subsequent homes.
#endstop_align_zero: False
#   If true then the position_endstop of the axis will effectively be
#   modified so that the zero position for the axis occurs at a full
#   step on the stepper motor. (If used on the Z axis and the print
#   layer height is a multiple of a full step distance then every
#   layer will occur on a full step.) The default is False.


# Heater cooling fans (one may define any number of sections with a
# "heater_fan" prefix). A "heater fan" is a fan that will be enabled
# whenever its associated heater is active. By default, a heater_fan
# has a shutdown_speed equal to max_power.

#   See the "fan" section in example.cfg for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#heater: extruder
#   Name of the config section defining the heater that this fan is
#   associated with. If a comma separated list of heater names is
#   provided here, then the fan will be enabled when any of the given
#   heaters are enabled. The default is "extruder".
#heater_temp: 50.0
#   A temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must drop below before
#   the fan is disabled. The default is 50 Celsius.
#fan_speed: 1.0
#   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
#   will be set to when its associated heater is enabled. The default
#   is 1.0


# Temperature-triggered cooling fans (one may define any number of
# sections with a "temperature_fan" prefix). A "temperature fan" is a
# fan that will be enabled whenever its associated sensor is above a
# set temperature. By default, a temperature_fan has a shutdown_speed
# equal to max_power.

#sensor_pin: analog13
#   See the "heater" section for details about the sensor_type and
#   sensor_pin parameters.
#min_temp: 0
#max_temp: 100
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   sensor must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. Set this range just wide enough so
#   that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error. These
#   parameters must be provided.

#   A temperature (in Celsius) that will be the target temperature.
#   The default is 40 degrees.
#max_speed: 1.0
#   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan

#   value.  The default is 0.3.
#control: watermark
#   Control algorithm (either watermark or pid). This parameter must
#   be provided.

#   Kp is the "proportional" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
#pid_Ki: 0.2
#   Ki is the "integral" constant for the pid. This parameter must be
#   provided for PID heaters.
#pid_Kd: 0.1
#   Kd is the "derivative" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
#pid_deriv_time: 2.0
#   A time value (in seconds) over which the derivative in the pid
#   will be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The
#   default is 2 seconds.
#pid_integral_max:
#   The maximum "windup" the integral term may accumulate. The default
#   is to use the same value as max_power.


# Additional micro-controllers (one may define any number of sections
# with an "mcu" prefix). Additional micro-controllers introduce
# additional pins that may be configured as heaters, steppers, fans,
# etc.. For example, if an "[mcu extra_mcu]" section is introduced,
# then pins such as "extra_mcu:ar9" may then be used elsewhere in the
# config (where "ar9" is a hardware pin name or alias name on the
# given mcu).
#[mcu my_extra_mcu]
# See the "mcu" section in example.cfg for configuration parameters.


# Servos (one may define any number of sections with a "servo"

#pin: ar7
#   PWM output pin controlling the servo. This parameter must be

#   The maximum angle (in degrees) that this servo can be set to. The
#   default is 180 degrees.

#   with an angle of 0 degrees. The default is 0.001 seconds.
#maximum_pulse_width: 0.002
#   The maximum pulse width time (in seconds). This should correspond
#   with an angle of maximum_servo_angle. The default is 0.002
#   seconds.
#initial_angle: 70
#   Initial angle to set the servo to when the mcu resets.  Must be between
#   0 and maximum_servo_angle  This parameter is optional.  If both

#initial_pulse_width: 0.0015
#   Initial pulse width time (in seconds) to set the servo to when
#   the mcu resets.  Must be between minimum_pulse_width and maximum_pulse_width.
#   This parameter is optional.  If both initial_angle and initial_pulse_width
#   are set initial_angle will be used


# Statically configured digital output pins (one may define any number
# of sections with a "static_digital_output" prefix). Pins configured
# here will be setup as a GPIO output during MCU configuration. They
# can not be changed at run-time.
#[static_digital_output my_output_pins]
#pins:
#   A comma separated list of pins to be set as GPIO output pins. The
#   pin will be set to a high level unless the pin name is prefaced
#   with "!". This parameter must be provided.


# Run-time configurable output pins (one may define any number of
# sections with an "output_pin" prefix). Pins configured here will be
# setup as output pins and one may modify them at run-time using
# "SET_PIN PIN=my_pin VALUE=.1" type extended g-code commands.
#[output_pin my_pin]
#pin:
#   The pin to configure as an output. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pwm: False
#   Set if the output pin should be capable of pulse-width-modulation.
#   If this is true, the value fields should be between 0 and 1; if it
#   is false the value fields should be either 0 or 1. The default is
#   False.
#static_value:
#   If this is set, then the pin is assigned to this value at startup
#   and the pin can not be changed during runtime. A static pin uses
#   slightly less ram in the micro-controller. The default is to use
#   runtime configuration of pins.
#value:
#   The value to initially set the pin to during MCU configuration.
#   The default is 0 (for low voltage).
#shutdown_value:
#   The value to set the pin to on an MCU shutdown event. The default
#   is 0 (for low voltage).
#printing_value:
#   If specified then the pin is set to the given value when the
#   printer starts printing and will be set back to the regular value
#   after printing stops. The default is to not change the pin state
#   during these events.
#cycle_time: 0.100
#   The amount of time (in seconds) per PWM cycle. It is recommended
#   this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software based

#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. The
#   default is False.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'value' and
#   'shutdown_value' parameters are interpreted for pwm pins. If
#   provided, then the 'value' parameter should be between 0.0 and
#   'scale'. This may be useful when configuring a PWM pin that
#   controls a stepper voltage reference. The 'scale' can be set to
#   the equivalent stepper amperage if the PWM were fully enabled, and
#   then the 'value' parameter can be specified using the desired
#   amperage for the stepper. The default is to not scale the 'value'
#   parameter.


# Multiple pin outputs (one may define any number of sections with a
# "multi_pin" prefix). A multi_pin output creates an internal pin
# alias that can modify multiple output pins each time the alias pin
# is set. For example, one could define a "[multi_pin my_fan]" object
# containing two pins and then set "pin=multi_pin:my_fan" in the
# "[fan]" section - on each fan change both output pins would be
# updated. These aliases may not be used with stepper motor pins.
#[multi_pin my_multi_pin]
#pins:
#   A comma separated list of pins associated with this alias. This
#   parameter must be provided.


# Statically configured AD5206 digipots connected via SPI bus (one may
# define any number of sections with an "ad5206" prefix).
#[ad5206 my_digipot]
#enable_pin:

#   will be set to low at the start of SPI messages and raised to high
#   after the message completes. This parameter must be provided.
#channel_1:
#channel_2:
#channel_3:
#channel_4:
#channel_5:
#channel_6:
#   The value to statically set the given AD5206 channel to. This is
#   typically set to a number between 0.0 and 1.0 with 1.0 being the
#   highest resistance and 0.0 being the lowest resistance. However,
#   the range may be changed with the 'scale' parameter (see below).
#   If a channel is not specified then it is left unconfigured.
#channel_<x>_while_printing:
#   If specified then the given channel is set to the given value when
#   the printer starts printing and will be set back to the default
#   value after printing stops. The default is to not change the
#   channel value at run-time.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'channel_x' parameters
#   are interpreted. If provided, then the 'channel_x' parameters
#   should be between 0.0 and 'scale'. This may be useful when the
#   AD5206 is used to set stepper voltage references. The 'scale' can
#   be set to the equivalent stepper amperage if the AD5206 were at

#   the range may be changed with the 'scale' parameter (see
#   below). If a wiper is not specified then it is left unconfigured.
#wiper_<x>_while_printing:
#   If specified then the given wiper is set to the given value when
#   the printer starts printing and will be set back to the default
#   value after printing stops. The default is to not change the wiper
#   value at run-time.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'wiper_x' parameters
#   are interpreted. If provided, then the 'wiper_x' parameters should
#   be between 0.0 and 'scale'. This may be useful when the MCP4451 is
#   used to set stepper voltage references. The 'scale' can be set to
#   the equivalent stepper amperage if the MCP4451 were at its highest
#   resistance, and then the 'wiper_x' parameters can be specified
#   using the desired amperage value for the stepper. The default is
#   to not scale the 'wiper_x' parameters.

#[homing_override]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines

#   commands listed here must home all axes. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#axes: xyz
#   The axes to override. For example, if this is set to "z" then the

#   still home all axes. The default is "xyz" which causes the
#   override script to be run in place of all G28 commands.
#set_position_x:
#set_position_y:
#set_position_z:
#   If specified, the printer will assume the axis is at the specified
#   position prior to running the above g-code commands. Setting this
#   disables homing checks for that axis. This may be useful if the
#   head must move prior to invoking the normal G28 mechanism for an
#   axis. The default is to not force a position for an axis.

# Note, using this feature may place the printer in an invalid state -
# see docs/G-Codes.md for important details.

# between a set of configured temperature/voltage measurements to
# determine the temperature. The resulting sensor can be used as a
# sensor_type in a heater section. (For example, if one defines a

# "gcode_macro" prefix).
#[gcode_macro my_cmd]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute in place of "my_cmd". This parameter is
#   evaluated using Python "string format syntax" with the command
#   parameters as named arguments. For example, if one were to define

#   "MY_DELAY DELAY=100" would evaluate to "G4 P100". This parameter
#   must be provided.
#default_parameter_<parameter>:
#   One may define any number of options with a "default_parameter_"
#   prefix. Use this to define default values for g-code parameters.
#   For example, if one were to define the macro MY_DELAY with gcode
#   "G4 P{DELAY}" along with "default_parameter_DELAY = 50" then the
