# VORON2 250mm config

# This is a base printer.cfg file for the VORON2 printer and matches the manual/build guide exactly
# for controllers used (dual RAMPS) and pin layout for all connected components.
# Created by "Boff" with help from the VORON community.

# For other build sizes, controllers, or non-standard pin connections, please see
# https://github.com/mzbotreprap/VORON/tree/master/Firmware/Klipper/Voron_2.1/Klipper/Configurations
# for other example Klipper configs created by the VORON community.

# This file is only an example - be sure to review and update it
# according to the specifics of your printer. See the example.cfg and
# example-extras.cfg files for a description of available Klipper parameters.

max_velocity: 350
max_accel: 3000
max_z_velocity: 50
max_z_accel: 350
#square_corner_velocity: 10.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.

#   advance.
#pressure_advance_lookahead_time: 0.010
#   A time (in seconds) to "look ahead" at future extrusion moves when

#   application of pressure advance during cornering moves that would
#   otherwise cause retraction followed immediately by pressure
#   buildup. This setting only applies if pressure_advance is

[probe]
# Inductive Probe
# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One
# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop.

#   Offset (in mm) for inductive probe in Z height
speed: 2.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line) to execute prior to each
#   probe attempt. This may be useful if the probe needs to be
#   activated in some way. The default is to not run any special
#   G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line) to execute after each
#   probe attempt completes. The default is to not run any special
#   G-Code commands on deactivation.

[fan]
# Print cooling fan
pin: ar9
#   D9 on mcu_xye
max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
#   enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the
#   pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
#   be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to
#   the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
#   will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if
#   max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
#   power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
#shutdown_speed: 0
#   The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if
#   the micro-controller software enters an error state. The default
#   is 0.
#cycle_time: 0.010
#   The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the
#   fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
#   using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. The
#   default is False.
kick_start_time: 0.500
#   Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when first enabling
#   it (helps get the fan spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.
