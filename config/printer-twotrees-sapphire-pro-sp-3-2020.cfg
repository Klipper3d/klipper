# This file contains common pin mappings for the Two Trees Sapphire
# Pro (SP-3) printer (Robin Nano 1.2, 2208 drivers for X,Y and A4988 for Z,E).

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the STM32F103.
# When running "make menuconfig", enable "extra low-level configuration setup",
# select the 28KiB bootloader, serial (on USART3 PB11/PB10) to use USB communication
# or serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) to use direct UART connection with Raspberry trough wifi pins.
# Set "GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup" to "!PC6,!PD13" to turn off display at startup.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLASHING, THE SCRIPT IS COMPULSORY OR IT WON'T WORK!!!
# Note that the "make flash" command does not work with the Robin Nano!
# After running "make", run the following command in one row FROM THE KLIPPER FOLDER:
#   ./scripts/update_mks_robin.py out/klipper.bin out/Robin_nano35.bin
# Copy the file out/Robin_nano35.bin (if you can't find the file the script was not executed)
# to an SD card and then restart the printer with that SD card.
# If you removed the LCD screen rename the file to "Robin_nano43.bin" for correct flashing.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
