# This file contains common configurations and pin mappings for the Prusa
# Mini+, which uses the Prusa Buddy board. The printer's LCD is not currently
# supported by Klipper, so the touchscreen will permanently display the
# bootloader screen after the Klipper firmware is flashed; use Fluidd, Mainsail,
# or OctoPrint etc. to control the printer.

# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the STM32F407. When
# running "make menuconfig", enable "extra low-level configuration setup",
# select the "128KiB + 512 byte offset" bootloader, and USB communication.
# Connect the printer to your Raspberry Pi using the printer's micro-USB port.
# If you prefer to remove Prusa's stock bootloader entirely, select the
# "No bootloader" option.

# When flashing for the first time, you will need to break the "appendix"
# on the Buddy board, then put the device into DFU mode by moving the jumper
# on the 3-pin header (older boards) or shorting the 2-pin header (newer boards)
# and resetting, and finally use "make flash" to install Klipper. Once Klipper is
# installed, you no longer need the jumper - just use "make flash" which will
# automatically put the device into DFU mode.

# Note that if you were previously running Prusa firmware, you must fully
# power cycle the board after flashing. Otherwise, Klipper will be unable to
# communicate with the TMC2209s due to the abrupt change in the baud rate,
# and will show this error: "Unable to read tmc uart register IFCNT".

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
