# This file contains common configurations and pin mappings for the FOKOOS
# Odin-5 F3, which uses the MKS Robin Nano v1.2 board. The printer's TFT
# touchscreen is not currently supported by Klipper, so the touchscreen will
# permanently display "Booting..." after the Klipper firmware is flashed; use
# Fluidd, Mainsail, or OctoPrint etc. to control the printer.

# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the STM32F103. When
# running "make menuconfig", enable "extra low-level configuration setup",
# select the 28KiB bootloader, and serial (on USART3 PB11/PB10) communication.
# Connect the printer to your Raspberry Pi using the printer's USB port.

# Note that the "make flash" command does not work with MKS Robin
# boards. After running "make", run the following command:
#   ./scripts/update_mks_robin.py out/klipper.bin out/Robin_nano35.bin
# Copy the file out/Robin_nano35.bin to an SD card and then restart the
# printer with that SD card. The firmware will automatically be flashed.

# WARNING: The printer's Z endstop inductive sensor is not very accurate, so
# stepper_z:position_endstop has been set to 0.0, for safety, below. This will
# prevent the nozzle crashing into the bed when you first home Z. You must
# follow Klipper's instructions for manually calibrating the Z endstop offset
# before you print anything. Be sure to leave room for a margin of error when
# you choose this parameter, i.e. choose a value 0.2-0.3mm smaller than the
# output of the calibration. For example, you might find the actual Z endstop
# position is at 0.5mm, in which case you could set the value to 0.2mm. It is
# recommended to manually level the bed before each print.

# This configuration does support the addition of a BLtouch. See below for
# further instructions.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

# BLtouch configuration. Uncomment these blocks if you have installed a
# BLtouch. The correct wiring is to use the Robin Nano's BLtouch port for the
# 3-wire connector (make sure you connect it the right way round) and the Z+
# endstop port for the 2-wire connector (use the innermost 2 pins, center is
# ground). Follow Klipper's instructions for installing and calibrating the
# BLtouch to set the correct x_offset, y_offset, and z_offset values below.
# There are headers available for the BLtouch on the right hand side of the
# toolhead, behind the fan cover. Check the connections carefully with a
# multimeter before using them. The wiring can be done through the ribbon
# cables, by connecting a BLtouch extension to the PCB attached to the
# left-hand Z stepper motor, but this requires either soldering directly to
# the PCB (likely easiest), or crimping extra pins into the connector to be
# found there.
