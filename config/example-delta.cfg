# This file serves as documentation for config parameters of delta
# style printers. One may copy and edit this file to configure a new
# delta printer. Only parameters unique to delta printers are
# described here - see the "example.cfg" file for description of
# common config parameters.

# DO NOT COPY THIS FILE WITHOUT CAREFULLY READING AND UPDATING IT
# FIRST. Incorrectly configured parameters may cause damage.

# The stepper_a section describes the stepper controlling the front
# left tower (at 210 degrees). This section also controls the homing
# parameters (homing_speed, homing_retract_dist) for all towers.

enable_pin: !ar38
step_distance: .01
endstop_pin: ^ar2
homing_speed: 50
position_endstop: 297.05
#   Distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the bed when the nozzle is
#   in the center of the build area and the endstop triggers. This
#   parameter must be provided for stepper_a; for stepper_b and
#   stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value specified for
#   stepper_a.
arm_length: 333.0
#   Length (in mm) of the diagonal rod that connects this tower to the
#   print head. This parameter must be provided for stepper_a; for
#   stepper_b and stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value
#   specified for stepper_a.
#angle:
#   This option specifies the angle (in degrees) that the tower is
#   at. The default is 210 for stepper_a, 330 for stepper_b, and 90
#   for stepper_c.

# The stepper_b section describes the stepper controlling the front
# right tower (at 330 degrees).

kinematics: delta
#   This option must be "delta" for linear delta printers.
max_velocity: 300
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 3000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_z_velocity: 150
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
#minimum_z_position: 0
#   The minimum Z position that the user may command the head to move
#   to.  The default is 0.
delta_radius: 174.75
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three linear
#   axis towers. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#    delta_radius = smooth_rod_offset - effector_offset - carriage_offset
#   This parameter must be provided.

# The delta_calibrate section enables a DELTA_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that can calibrate the tower endstop positions and
# angles.
[delta_calibrate]
radius: 50
#   Radius (in mm) of the area that may be probed. This is the radius
#   of nozzle coordinates to be probed; if using an automatic probe
#   with an XY offset then choose a radius small enough so that the
#   probe always fits over the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
