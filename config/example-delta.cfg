# This file serves as documentation for config parameters of delta
# style printers. One may copy and edit this file to configure a new
# delta printer. Only parameters unique to delta printers are
# described here - see the "example.cfg" file for description of
# common config parameters.

# DO NOT COPY THIS FILE WITHOUT CAREFULLY READING AND UPDATING IT
# FIRST. Incorrectly configured parameters may cause damage.

# The stepper_a section describes the stepper controlling the front
# left tower (at 210 degrees). This section also controls the homing
# parameters (homing_speed, homing_retract_dist) and maximum tower
# length (position_max) for all towers.

[printer]
kinematics: delta
#   This option must be "delta" for linear delta printers.
max_velocity: 300
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This limits the velocity of the toolhead relative to the
#   print - at the extreme end of the print envelope the delta axis
#   steppers themselves may briefly exceed this speed by up to 3
#   times. This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 3000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This limits the acceleration of the toolhead relative to
#   the print - at the extreme end of the print envelope the delta
#   axis steppers may briefly exceed this acceleration by up to 3
#   times. This parameter must be specified.
max_z_velocity: 200
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
delta_arm_length: 333.0
#   Length (in mm) of the diagonal rods that connect the linear axes
#   to the print head. This parameter must be provided.
delta_radius: 174.75
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three linear
#   axis towers. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#    delta_radius = smooth_rod_offset - effector_offset - carriage_offset
#   This parameter must be provided.
