The Klipper firmware controls 3d-Printers. It combines the power of a
general purpose computer with one or more micro-controllers. See the
[features document](https://www.klipper3d.org/Features.html) for more
information on why you should use the Klipper software.

Start by [installing Klipper software](https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html).

Klipper software is Free Software. See the [license](COPYING) or read
the [documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html). We
depend on the generous support from our
[sponsors](https://www.klipper3d.org/Sponsors.html).
