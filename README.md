# Ender 3 V3 KE Klipper (Rebased Source Tree)

Creality released the source code for Ender 3 V3 KE on [Jan. 10, 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creality/comments/193615t).
Because they decided to do it the horrible way, i.e., uploaded a simple dump of their current version _without_ the Git history
nor the list of changes they've made, digging to find when they have started working on their version is close to impossible.

This repository attempts to fill that gap, by manually rebasing Creality's releases to the Klipper Git Tree.
(Wasn't this supposed to be _your_ job, Creality?)

The Klipper firmware controls 3d-Printers. It combines the power of a
general purpose computer with one or more micro-controllers. See the
[features document](https://www.klipper3d.org/Features.html) for more
information on why you should use the Klipper software.
